<p>Hitherto we have beheld Man only in his material
organism; as a wild though intellectual animal. We
have watched the intercourse of uncultured mind with
its environment. We have seen how, to clothe himself,
the savage robs the beast; how, like animals, primitive
man constructs his habitation, provides food, rears a
family, exercises authority, holds property, wages war,
indulges in amusements, gratifies social instincts; and
that in all this, the savage is but one remove from the
brute. Ascending the scale, we have examined the first
stages of human progress and analyzed an incipient civilization.
We will now pass the frontier which separates
mankind from animal-kind, and enter the domain of the
immaterial and supernatural; phenomena which philosophy
purely positive cannot explain.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">2</a></span></p>

<p>The primary indication of an absolute superiority in
man over other animals is the faculty of speech; not
those mute or vocal symbols, expressive of passion and
emotion, displayed alike in brutes and men; but the
power to separate ideas, to generate in the mind and
embody in words, sequences of thought. True, upon the
threshold of this inquiry, as in whatever relates to
primitive man, we find the brute creation hotly pursuing,
and disputing for a share in this progressional power.
In common with man, animals possess all the organs of
sensation. They see, hear, feel, taste, and smell. They
have even the organs of speech; but they have not
speech. The source of this wonderful faculty lies further
back, obscured by the mists which ever settle round the
immaterial. Whether brutes have souls, according to
the Aristotelean theory of soul, or whether brute-soul is
immortal, or of quality and destiny unlike and inferior
to that of man-soul, we see in them unmistakable evidence
of mental faculties. The higher order of animals
possess the lower order of intellectual perceptions. Thus
pride is manifested by the caparisoned horse, shame by
the beaten dog, will by the stubborn mule. Brutes
have memory; they manifest love and hate, joy and
sorrow, gratitude and revenge. They are courageous or
cowardly, subtle or simple, not merely up to the measure
of what we commonly term instinct, but with evident
exercise of judgment; and, to a certain point, we
might even claim for them foresight, as in laying in a
store of food for winter. But with all this there seems
to be a lack of true or connected thought, and of the faculty
of abstraction, whereby conceptions are analyzed
and impressions defined.</p>

<p class="sidenote">THOUGHT AND EXPRESSION.</p>

<p>They have also a language, such as it is; indeed, all
the varieties of language common to man. What gesture-language
can be more expressive than that employed
by the horse with its ears and by the dog with its tail,
wherein are manifestations of every shade of joy, sorrow,
courage, fear, shame, and anger? In their brutish
physiognomy, also, one may read the language of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">3</a></span>
emotions, which, if not so delicately pictured as in the
face of man, is none the less distinctive. Nor are they
without their vocal language. Every fowl and every
quadruped possesses the power of communicating intelligence
by means of the voice. They have their noise of
gladness, their signal cry of danger, their notes of
anger and of woe. Thus we see in brutes not only intelligence
but the power of communicating intelligence.
But intelligence is not thought, neither is expression
speech. The language of brutes, like themselves, is soulless.</p>

<p>The next indication of man's superiority over brutes, is
the faculty of worship. The wild beast, to escape the
storm, flies howling to its den; the savage, awe-stricken,
turns and prays. The lowest man perceives a hand behind
the lightning, hears a voice abroad upon the storm,
for which the highest brute has neither eye nor ear. This
essential of humanity we see primordially displayed in
mythic phenomena; in the first struggle of spiritual manhood
to find expression. Language is symbol significant
of thought, mythology is symbol significant of soul. The
one is the first distinctive sound that separates the ideal
from the material, the other the first respiration of the
soul which distinguishes the immortal from the animal.
Language is thought incarnate; mythology, soul incarnate.
The one is the instrument of thought, as the other
is the essence of thought. Neither is thought; both are
closely akin to thought; separated from either, in some
form, perfect intellectual manhood cannot develop. I
do not mean to say with some, that thought without
speech cannot exist; unless by speech is meant any form
of expression symbolical, emotional, or vocal, or unless
by thought is meant something more than mere self-consciousness
without sequence and without abstraction.
There can be no doubt that speech is the living breath
of thought, and that the exercise of speech reacts upon
the mental and emotional faculties. In brutes is found
neither speech nor myth; in the deaf and dumb, thought
and belief are shadowy and undefined; in infants,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">4</a></span>
thought is but as a fleeting cloud passing over the brain.
Yet for all this, deaf mutes and children who have no
adequate form of expression cannot be placed in the category
of brutes. The invention of the finger-alphabet
opened a way to the understanding of the deaf and dumb;
but long before this is learned, in every instance, these
unfortunates invent a gesture-language of their own, in
which they think as well as speak. And could we but see
the strangely contorted imagery which takes possession
of a gesture-thinker's brain, we should better appreciate
the value of words. So, into the mouth of children
words are put, round which thoughts coalesce; but evidences
of ideas are discovered some time before they can
be fully expressed by signs or sounds. Kant held the
opinion that the mind of a deaf mute is incapable of
development, but the wonderful success of our modern
institutions has dissipated forever that idea.</p>

<p>The soul of man is a half-conscious inspiration from
which perception and expression are inseparable. Nature
speaks to it in that subtle sympathy by which the
immaterial within holds converse with the immaterial
without, in the soft whisperings of the breeze, in the
fearful bellowings of the tempest. Between the soul
and body there is the closest sympathy, an interaction in
every relation. Therefore these voices of nature speaking
to nature's offspring, are answered back in various
ways according to the various organisms addressed. The
animal, the intellectual, the spiritual, whatsoever the
entity consists of, responds, and responding expands and
unfolds. Once give an animal the power to speak and
mental development ensues; for speech cannot continue
without ideas, and ideas cannot spring up without intellectual
evolution. A dim, half-conscious, brutish thought
there may be; but the faculty of abstraction, sequences
of thought, without words either spoken or unspoken,
cannot exist.</p>

<p class="sidenote">ORIGIN OF LANGUAGE.</p>

<p>It is not at all probable that a system of gesture-language
was ever employed by any primitive people, prior
or in preference to vocal language. To communicate by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">5</a></span>
signs requires no little skill and implies a degree of artifice
and forethought far beyond that required in vocal
or emotional language. Long before a child arrives at
the point of intelligence necessary for conveying thought
by signs, it is well advanced in a vocal language of its
own.</p>

<p>In mythology, language assumes personality and independence.
Often the significance of the word becomes
the essential idea. Zeus, from meaning simply sky, becomes
god of the sky; Eos, originally the dawn, is made
the goddess of the opening day. Not the idea but the
expression of the idea becomes the deity. And so, by
these creations of fancy, the imagination expands; in
the embodiment of the idea, the mind enlarges with its
own creation. Then yet bolder metaphors are thrown
off like soap-bubbles, which no sooner take form in
words than they are also deified. Thus soul and thought
and speech act and react on one another, all the evolutions
of conception seeking vent in sound or speculation;
and thus language, the expression of mind, and mythology,
the expression of soul, become the exponents of
divine humanity.</p>

<p>But what then is Language, what is Myth, and whence
are they? Broadly, the term language may be applied
to whatever social beings employ to communicate
passion or sentiment, or to influence one another;
whatever is made a vehicle of intelligence, ideographic
or phonetic, is language. In this category may be placed,
as we have seen, gestures, both instinctive and artificial;
emotional expression, displayed in form or feature; vocal
sounds, such as the cries of birds, the howling of beasts.
Indeed, language is everywhere, in everything. While
listening to the rippling brook, the roaring sea, the murmuring
forest, as well as to the still small voice within,
we are but reading from the vocabulary of nature.</p>

<p>Thus construed, the principle assumes a variety
of shapes, and may be followed through successive
stages of development. In fact, neither form nor feature
can be set in motion, or even left in a state of repose,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">6</a></span>
without conveying intelligence to the observer. The
countenance of man, whether it will or not, perpetually
speaks, and speaks in most exquisite shades of significance,
and with expression far more delicate than that
employed by tongue or pen. The face is the reflex of
the soul; a transparency which glows with light, divine
or devilish, thrown upon it from within. It is a portrait
of individual intelligence, a photograph of the inner
being, a measure of innate intelligence. And in all
pertaining to the actions and passions of mankind, what
can be more expressive than the language of the emotions?
There are the soft, silent wooings of love, the
frantic fury of hate, the dancing delirium of joy, the
hungry cravings of desire, the settled melancholy of dead
hopes. But more definitely, language is articulate
human speech or symbolic expression of ideas.</p>

<p>How man first learned to speak, and whence the power
of speech was originally derived, are questions concerning
which tradition is uncommunicative. Even mythology,
which attempts the solution of supernatural mysteries,
the explanation of all phenomena not otherwise
accounted for, has little to say as to the genesis of this
most potential of all human powers.</p>

<p>Many theories have been advanced concerning the
origin of language. Some of them are exploded; others
in various stages of modification remain, no two philologists
thinking exactly alike. The main hypotheses
are three; the subordinate ones are legion. Obviously,
speech must be either a direct, completed gift of the
Creator, with one or more independent beginnings; or a
human invention; or an evolution from a natural germ.</p>

<p>Schleicher conceives primordial language to be a simple
organism of vocal gestures; Gould Brown believes
language to be partly natural and partly artificial; Adam
Smith and Dugald Stewart give to man the creation and
development of speech by his own artificial invention.
According to Herodotus, the Phrygians and the Egyptians
disputed over the question of the antiquity of their languages.
Psammetichus thereupon confided two babes to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">7</a></span>
the care of goats, apart from every human sound. At
the end of two years they were heard to pronounce the
word <i>bekos</i>, the Phrygian for bread. The Phrygians
therefore claimed for their language the seniority.</p>

<p class="sidenote">SCIENCE OF PHILOLOGY.</p>

<p>In ancient times it was thought that there was some
one primeval tongue, a central language from which all
the languages of the earth radiated. The Sythic,
Ethiopic, Chinese, Greek, Latin, and other languages
advanced claims for this seniority. Plato believed language
to be an invention of the gods, and by them given
to man. Orthodox religionists did not hesitate to affirm
that Hebrew, the language of Paradise, was not only
given in a perfected state to man, but was miraculously
preserved in a state of purity for the chosen Israel.
After the dispersion from Babel, such nations as relapsed
into barbarism became barbaric in speech. And in the
roots of every dialect of both the old world and the
new, the Fathers were able to discern Hebrew analogies
sufficient to confirm them in their dogma. Indeed other
belief was heresy.</p>

<p>There were others who held that, when gesture-language
and the language of the emotions were found
insufficient for the growing necessities of man, by common
consent, it was agreed that certain objects should be
represented by certain sounds, and that so, when a word
had been invented for every object, language was made.</p>

<p>Another doctrine, called by Mr. Wedgwood, its enthusiastic
advocate, 'onomatop&oelig;ia,' and by Professor Max
Müller the 'bow-wow' theory, explains the origin of
language in the effort of man to imitate the cries of
nature. Thus, for dog the primitive languageless man
would say bow-wow; to the rivulet, the wind, the birds
and beasts, names were applied which as far as possible
were but reproductions of the sounds made by these elements
or animals.</p>

<p>Thus philology up to a comparatively late period was
a speculation rather than a science. Philosophers sought
to know whence language came rather than what language
is. But when the great discovery concerning the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">8</a></span>
Arian and Semitic families was made, comparative
philologists went to work after the manner of practical
investigators in other branches of study, by collecting,
classifying and comparing vocabularies, and therefrom
striking out a path backward to original trunks.
Catalogues of languages were published, one in 1800 by
Hervas, a Spanish Jesuit, containing three hundred dialects,
followed by Adelung and Vater's Mithridates, from
1806-17. But not until Sanscrit was made a subject of
European study did it become apparent that affinities of
tongues are subject to the laws that govern affinities
of blood. Then it was that a similarity was discovered,
not only between the Sanscrit and the Greek and Latin
tongues, but between these languages and the Teutonic,
Celtic, Iranic, and Indic, all of which became united in
the great Arian family. At the same time, the ancient
language of the Jews, the Arabic, and the Aramaic&mdash;which
constitute the Semitic family&mdash;were found to be
totally different from the Arian in their radical structure.
From these investigations, philologists were no
less convinced that the Indo-European languages were
all of the same stock, than that the Semitic idioms did
not belong to it. The doctrine of the Fathers therefore
would not stand; for it was found that all languages
were not derivations from the Hebrew, nor from any
other known central tongue.</p>

<p>Then too, the subordination of tongues to the laws of
evolution became apparent. It was discovered that language
was in a state of constant change; that, with all
its variations, human speech could be grouped into families,
and degrees of relationship ascertained; and that, by
the comparison of vocabularies, a classification at once
morphological and genealogical could be made. Varieties
of tongues, as numberless as the phases of humanity,
could be traced back towards their beginnings and resolved
into earlier forms. It was discovered that in the first
order of linguistic development, words are monosyllabic.
In this rudimentary stage, to which the Chinese, Tibetan,
and perhaps the Japanese belong, roots, or sounds expressive
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">9</a></span>
only of the material or substantial parts of
things, are used. In the second stage, called the polysynthetic,
aggregative, or agglutinate, a modifying termination,
significant of the relations of ideas or things
to each other, is affixed or glued to the root. To the
agglutinate languages belong the American and Turanian
families. In the third, called the inflectional
stage, which comprises only the Arian and Semitic families,
the two elements are more perfectly developed, and
it is only in this stage that language can attain the
highest degree of richness and refinement.</p>

<p class="sidenote">VARIATIONS OF LANGUAGE.</p>

<p>While these stages or conditions are recognized by all,
it is claimed on one side that although settled languages
retain their grammatical character, every agglutinate
language must once have been monosyllabic, or radical,
and every inflectional language once agglutinate; and on
the other side it is averred that the assertion is incapable
of proof, for no historical evidence exists of any one
type ever having passed from one of these stages to
another. Now if speech is a perfected gift of the Creator,
how happens it that we find language in every stage
of development or relapse, from the cluckings of Thlinkeets
to the classic lines of Homer and of Shakspeare?
In his physiological structure, so far as is known, Man is
neither more nor less perfect now than in the days of
Adam. How then if language is an organism, is it, unlike
other organisms, subject to extreme and sudden
change? In animated nature there are two principles;
one fixed and finished as an organism, subject to perpetual
birth and decay, but incapable of advancing or
retrograding; the other, elemental life, the germ or centre
of a future development. The one grows, the other
unfolds. We have no evidence that instincts and
organic functions were more or less perfect in the beginning
than now. If therefore language is an instinct
or an organism, a perfect gift of the Creator, how can it
exist otherwise than in a concrete and perfect state like
other instincts and organisms?</p>

<p>The absurdity that human speech is the invention of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">10</a></span>
primitive man&mdash;that upon some grassy knoll a company
of half-clad barbarians met, and without words invented
words, without significant sounds produced sounds significant
of every object, therein by mutual consent
originating a language&mdash;may be set aside. Of all conjectures
concerning the origin of language, the hypothesis
that words are an artificial invention is the least tenable.
And what is most surprising to us, at the present day,
is that such men as Locke and Adam Smith and Dugald
Stewart could for a moment have entertained the idea.
Obviously, without language there could be no culture,
and without culture, words never could have been invented.
Words are the symbols of objects and ideas.
Certain words may be arbitrarily selected, and, by the
tacit agreement or general concurrence of society, may
be made to signify certain things. And in this sense
words may originate conventionally. But though words
may have been conventionally selected, they were never
selected by conventions. We then have the discoveries
of modern philologists, not only to positively deny the
infallibility of the common-origin theory, but to bring
forward a number of other claimants for the greatest
antiquity, as well entitled to a hearing as the Hebrew.</p>

<p class="sidenote">UNIVERSALITY OF SPEECH.</p>

<p>Diversity in the origin of speech does not of necessity
imply diversity in the origin of race. Thus with a
unity of race, circumstances may be conceived in
which independent tongues may have arisen in different
localities; whereas with a diversity of race, but one language
hypothetically may have been given to all. A
common origin is probable, a diversity of origin is possible;
neither can be proved or disproved. The radical
differences in the structure of the three great types, the
monosyllabic, the agglutinate, and the inflectional; and
the inherent heterogeneities of the several families of the
same type, as of the Chinese and Siamese, of the American
and Turanian, or even of the Arian and Semitic, would
seem to present insurmountable obstacles to the theory
of a common origin; while on the other hand the wonderful
mutations of types and trunks, the known transformations
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">11</a></span>
of language, and the identifications by some
philologists, of the same stock in each of the three progressional
stages, render the theory of a unity of origin
in language equally probable. Therefore the question
of unity or diversity of tongues, as we speak of
unity or diversity of race, can be of but little moment
to us. Language shows the connection between nations
widely separated, leads us back beyond tradition into
the obscure past, follows the sinuosities of migrations,
indicates epochs in human development, points towards
the origin of peoples, serves as a guide in following the
radiation of races from common centres. Yet a similarity
in the sound, or even in the construction of two
words, does not necessarily imply relationship. Two
totally distinct languages may have borrowed the same
word from a third language; which fact would never
establish relationship between the borrowers. When
like forms are found in different languages, in order
to establish a relationship, historical evidence must be
applied as a test, and the words followed up to their
roots.</p>

<p>Stripped of technicalities, the question before us is
reduced to a few simple propositions. All men speak;
there never yet was found a nation without articulate
language. Aside from individual and abnormal exceptions,
no primitive tribe has ever been discovered, where
part of the people spoke, and part were speechless. Language
is as much a part of man, as any physical constituent;
yet unlike physical organs, as the eye, the ear,
the hand, language is not born with the individual. It
is not in the blood. The Caucasian infant stolen by
Apaches, cannot converse with its own mother when
restored to her a few years after.</p>

<p>Therefore speech is not an independent, perfected gift
of the Creator, but an incidental acquirement. Furthermore
language is an attribute of society. It belongs to
the people and not to the individual. The child before
mentioned, if dropped by the Apaches among the bears
and by them nurtured and reared, is doomed to mutism
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">12</a></span>
or bear-language. Man was made a social being; speech
was made as a means of communicating intelligence between
social beings; one individual alone never could
originate, or even preserve a language.</p>

<p>But how then happens it, if man did not make it, and
God did not give it him, that human speech is universal?
With the organism of man the Creator implants the
organs of speech. With the elemental and progressional
life of man the Creator implants the germ of speech.
In common with the element of progress and civilization,
innate from the beginning, speech has developed by slow
degrees through thousands of cycles and by various stages,
marching steadily forward with the forward march of
the intellect. Comparative philology, in common with
all other sciences, accords to man a remote antiquity.
Bunsen estimates that at least twenty thousand years are
required for a language to pass from one rudimentary
stage to another.</p>

<p>The mind receives impressions and the soul intuitions,
and to throw them off in some form is an absolute necessity.
Painful impressions tend to produce bodily contortions
and dolorous sounds; pleasant impressions to illumine
the features and to make musical the voice. And
not only is this compressed emotion destined to find expression,
but to impress itself upon others. Emotion is
essentially sympathetic. Why certain objects are represented
by certain sounds we can never know. Some
think that between every word and the object or idea
which it represents, there was in the first instance an
intimate relationship. By degrees certain natural articulations
became associated with certain ideas; then
new names were suggested by some fancied analogy to
objects already named. Everything else being equal,
similar conditions and causations produce similar impressions
and are expressed by similar sounds. Hence a
certain uniformity between all human tongues; and a tendency
in man to imitate the sounds in nature, the cries
of animals, the melodies of winds and waters, accounts
for the origin of many words.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">13</a></span></p>

<p>From giving expression in some outward form to our
inward emotion there is no escape. Let us now apply
to the expression of feeling and emotion the same law
of evolution which governs all social and intellectual
phenomena, and from a language of exclamations, we
have first the monosyllabic noun and verb, then auxilliaries&mdash;adverbs,
adjectives, prepositions and pronouns&mdash;and
finally inflections of parts of speech by
which the finer shades of meaning may be expressed.</p>

<p>The spontaneous outbursts of feeling, or the metaphorical
expressions of emotion, arising instinctively
and acting almost simultaneously with the conception
or impression made upon the mind, develop with time
into settled forms of speech. Man speaks as birds
fly or fishes swim. The Creator supplies the organs
and implants the instinct. Speech, though intuitive,
is more than intuition; for, as we have seen, speech
is a social rather than an individual attribute. Darwin
perceives in language not only a spontaneous generation,
but a natural selection of grammatical forms;
the best words, the clearest and shortest expressions,
continually displacing the weaker. So words are made
to fit occasions, and dropped as soon as better ones can
be found.</p>

<p>Languages are not inherited, yet language is an inheritance.
Language is not artificially invented, yet
languages are but conventional agreements. Languages
are not a concrete perfected gift of the Creator, yet the
germ of language is ineradicably implanted in man, and
was there implanted by none but man's Creator. This
then is Language: it is an acquisition, but an acquisition
from necessity; it is a gift, but, when given, an
undeveloped germ; it is an artifice, in so far as it is
developed by the application of individual agencies.</p>

<p class="sidenote p2">MYTHOLOGY.</p>

<p class="p2">Here, for a while, we will leave Language and turn
to Mythology, the <i>mythos</i> 'fable' and <i>logos</i> 'speech' of
the Grecians.</p>

<p>Under analysis mythology is open to broad yet significant
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">14</a></span>
interpretations. As made up of legendary accounts
of places and personages, it is history; as relating
to the genesis of the gods, the nature and adventures
of divinities, it is religion; placed in the category of
science, it is the science of fable; of philosophy, the
philosophy of intuitive beliefs. A mass of fragmentary
truth and fiction not open to rationalistic criticism; a
system of tradition, genealogical and political, confounding
the subjective with the objective; a partition wall of
allegories, built of dead facts cemented with wild fancies&mdash;it
looms ever between the immeasurable and the
measurable past.</p>

<p>Thick black clouds, portentous of evil, hang threateningly
over the savage during his entire life. Genii
murmur in the flowing river, in the rustling branches
are felt the breathings of the gods, goblins dance in
vapory twilight, and demons howl in the darkness.</p>

<p>In the myths of wild, untutored man, is displayed
that inherent desire to account for the origin of things,
which, even at the present time, commands the profoundest
attention of philosophy; and, as we look back
upon the absurd conceptions of our savage ancestry with
feelings akin to pity and disgust, so may the speculations
of our own times appear to those who shall come after us.
Those weird tales which to us are puerility or poetry, according
as we please to regard them, were to their believers
history, science, and religion. Yet this effort, which
continues from the beginning to the end, is not valueless;
in it is embodied the soul of human progress. Without
mythology, the only door at once to the ideal and inner
life of primitive peoples and to their heroic and historic
past would be forever closed to us. Nothing so reflects
their heart-secrets, exposes to our view their springs of
action, shadows forth the sources of their hopes and
fears, exhibits the models after which they moulded
their lives.</p>

<p>Within crude poetic imagery are enrolled their religious
beliefs, are laid the foundations of their systems
of worship, are portrayed their thoughts concerning
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">15</a></span>
causations and the destinies of mankind. Under symbolic
veils is shrouded their ancient national spirit, all
that can be known of their early history and popular
ideas. Thus are explained the fundamental laws of nature;
thus we are told how earth sprang from chaos, how
men and beasts and plants were made, how heaven was
peopled, and earth, and what were the relative powers
and successive dynasties of the gods. Heroes are made
gods; gods are materialized and brought down to men.</p>

<p class="sidenote">ALL MYTHS FOUNDED ON FACT.</p>

<p>Of the value of mythology it is unnecessary here to
speak. Never was there a time in the history of philosophy
when the character, customs, and beliefs of
aboriginal man, and everything appertaining to him, were
held in such high esteem by scholars as at present. As
the ultimate of human knowledge is approached, the inquirer
is thrown back upon the past; and more and more
the fact becomes apparent, that what is, is but a reproduction
of what has been; that in the earlier stages
of human development may be found the counterpart of
every phase of modern social life. Higher and more
heterogeneous as are our present systems of politics and
philosophy, every principle, when tracked to its beginning,
proves to have been evolved, not originated.</p>

<p>As there never yet was found a people without a language,
so every nation has its mythology, some popular
and attractive form for preserving historical tradition
and presenting ethical maxims; and as by the range
of their vocabularies we may follow men through all
the stages of their progress in government, domestic
affairs and mechanical arts, so, by beliefs expressed, we
may determine at any given epoch in the history of a
race their ideal and intellectual condition. Without the
substance there can be no shadow, without the object
there can be no name for it; therefore when we find a
language without a word to denote property or chastity,
we may be sure that the wealth and women of the tribe
are held in common; and when in a system of mythology
certain important metaphysical or æsthetic ideas and attributes
are wanting, it is evident that the intellect of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">16</a></span>
its composers has not yet reached beyond a certain low
point of conception.</p>

<p>Moreover, as in things evil may be found a spirit
of good, so in fable we find an element of truth.
It is now a recognized principle of philosophy, that no
religious belief, however crude, nor any historical tradition,
however absurd, can be held by the majority of a
people for any considerable time as true, without having
in the beginning some foundation in fact. More especially
is the truth of this principle apparent when we
consider that in all the multitudinous beliefs of all ages,
held by peoples savage and civilized, there exist a concurrence
of ideas and a coincidence of opinion. Human
conceptions of supernatural affairs spring from like intuitions.
As human nature is essentially the same throughout
the world and throughout time, so the religious
instincts which form a part of that universal humanity
generate and develop in like manner under like conditions.
The desire to penetrate hidden surroundings
and the method of attempting it are to a certain extent
common to all. All wonder at the mysterious; all
attempt the solution of mysteries; all primarily possess
equal facilities for arriving at correct conclusions. The
genesis of belief is uniform, and the results under like
conditions analogous.</p>

<p>We may conclude that the purposes for which these
fictitious narratives were so carefully preserved and
handed down to posterity were two-fold&mdash;to keep alive
certain facts and to inculcate certain doctrines.</p>

<p class="sidenote">VALUE OF MYTHOLOGY.</p>

<p>Something there must have been in every legend, in
every tradition, in every belief, which has ever been entertained
by the majority of a people, to recommend it
to the minds of men in the first instance. Error absolute
cannot exist; false doctrine without an amalgam of
verity speedily crumbles, and the more monstrous the
falsity the more rapid its decomposition. Myths were
the oracles of our savage ancestors; their creed, the rule
of their life, prized by them as men now prize their
faith; and, by whatever savage philosophy these strange
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">17</a></span>
conceits were eliminated, their effect upon the popular
mind was vital. Anaxagoras, Socrates, Protagoras, and
Epicurus well knew and boldly proclaimed that the
gods of the Grecians were disreputable characters, not
the kind of deities to make or govern worlds; yet so
deep rooted in the hearts of the people were the maxims
of the past, that for these expressions one heretic was
cast into prison, another expelled from Athens, and
another forced to drink the hemlock. And the less
a fable presents the appearance of probability, the more
grotesque and extravagant it is, the less the likelihood
of its having originated in pure invention; for no extravagantly
absurd invention without a particle of truth
could by any possibility have been palmed off upon a
people, and by them accepted, revered, recited, preserved
as veritable incident or solution of mystery, and handed
down to those most dear to them, to be in like manner
held as sacred.</p>

<p>Therefore we may be sure that there never was a
myth without a meaning; that mythology is not a bundle
of ridiculous fancies invented for vulgar amusement;
that there is not one of these stories, no matter how
silly or absurd, which was not founded in fact, which did
not once hold a significance. "And though I have well
weighed and considered all this," concluded Lord Bacon,
nearly three hundred years ago, "and thoroughly seen
into the levity which the mind indulges for allegories
and illusions, yet I cannot but retain a high value for
the ancient mythology." Indeed, to ancient myths has
been attributed the preservation of shattered fragments
of lost sciences, even as some have alleged that we are
indebted to the writings of Democritus and Aristotle for
modern geographical discoveries.</p>

<p>That these ductile narratives have suffered in their
transmission to us, that through the magnifying and
refracting influences of time, and the ignorance and
fanaticism of those to whom they were first recited, we
receive them mutilated and distorted, there can be no
doubt. Not one in a thousand of those aboriginal
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">18</a></span>
beliefs which were held by the people of the Pacific
Coast at the time of its first occupation by foreigners,
has been preserved. And for the originality and
purity of such as we have, in many instances, no one
can vouch. Certain writers who saw in the native
fable probable evidence of the presence of an apostle, or
a miraculous interposition in the affairs of benighted
heathendom, could but render the narrative in accordance
with their prepossessions. The desire of some to
prove a certain origin for the Indians, and the contempt
of others for native character, also led to imperfect or
colored narrations. But happily, enough has been preserved
in authentic picture-writings, and by narrators
whose integrity and intelligence are above suspicion, to
give us a fair insight into the native psychological structure
and belief; and if the knowledge we have is but infinitesimal
in comparison with what has been lost, we
may thereby learn to prize more highly such as we have.</p>

<p>Again we come to the ever-recurring question&mdash;Whence
is it? Whence arise belief, worship, superstition?
Whence the striking likeness in all supernatural
conceptions between nations and ages the most diverse?
Why is it that so many peoples, during the successive
stages of their progress, have their creation myth, their
origin myth, their flood myth, their animal, and plant,
and planet myths? This coincidence of evolution can
scarcely be the result of accident. Mythologies, then,
being like languages common to mankind, uniform in
substance yet varying in detail, what follows with regard
to the essential system of their supernatural conceptions?
Is it a perfected gift of the Creator, the
invention of a designing priesthood, or a spontaneous
generation and natural development? So broad a question,
involving as it does the weightiest matters connected
with man, may scarcely expect exactly the same
answer from any two persons. Origin of life, origin of
mind, origin of belief, are as much problems to the
profoundest philosopher of to-day, as they were to the
first wondering, bewildered savage who wandered
through primeval forests.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">19</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">ORIGIN OF BELIEF.</p>

<p>Life is defined by Herbert Spencer as "the coördination
of actions, or their continuous adjustment;" by
Lewes as "a series of definite and successive changes,
both of structure and composition, which take place
within an individual without destroying its identity;"
by Schelling as "the tendency to individuation;" by
Richeraud as "a collection of phenomena which succeed
each other during a limited time in an organized body;"
and by De Blainville as "the two-fold internal movement
of composition and decomposition, at once general and
continuous." According to Hume, Mind is but a bundle
of ideas and impressions which are the sum of all knowledge,
and consequently, "the only things known to exist."
In the positive philosophy of Auguste Comte, intellectual
development is divided into three phases; namely,
the Supernatural, in which the mind seeks for supernatural
causes; the Metaphysical, wherein abstract
forces are set up in place of supernatural agencies; and
the Positive, which inquires into the laws which engender
phenomena. Martineau, commenting upon intuition and
the mind's place in nature, charges the current doctrine of
evolution with excluding the element of life from developing
organisms. Until the origin of mind, and the relation
of mind to its environment is determined, the origin
of the supernatural must remain unaccounted for. Yet we
may follow the principle of worship back to very near
its source, if we are unable entirely to account for it.</p>

<p>We have seen how the inability of brutes to form in
the mind long sequences of thought, prevents speech;
so, in primitive societies, when successions of unrecorded
events are forgotten before any conception of general
laws can be formed therefrom, polytheism in its grossest
form is sure to prevail. Not until the earlier stages of
progress are passed, and, from a multitude of correlative
and oft-repeated experiences, general deductions made,
can there be any higher religious conceptions than that
of an independent cause for every consequence.</p>

<p>By some it is alleged that the religious sentiment is a
divine idea perfected by the Creator and implanted in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span>
man as part of his nature, before his divergence from
a primitive centre. Singularly enough, the Fathers of
the Church referred the origin of fable as well as the
origin of fact to the Hebrew Scriptures. Supported by
the soundest sophistry, they saw in every myth, Grecian
or barbarian, a biblical character. Thus the Greek
Hercules was none other than the Hebrew Sampson;
Arion was Jonah, and Deucalion Noah. Other mythological
characters were supposed by them to have been
incarnated fiends, who disappeared after working for a
time their evil upon men.</p>

<p>There have been those who held myths to be the
fictions of sorcery, as there are now those who believe
that forms of worship were invented by a designing
priesthood, or that mythology is but a collection of tales,
physical, ethical and historical, invented by the sages
and ancient wise men of the nation, for the purpose of
overawing the wicked and encouraging the good. Some
declare that religion is a factitious or accidental social
phenomenon; others that it is an aggregation of organized
human experiences; others that it is a bundle of
sentiments which were originally projected by the imagination,
and ultimately adopted as entities; others
that it is a feeling or emotion, the genesis of which is
due to surrounding circumstances.</p>

<p>Many believe all mythological personages to have been
once real human heroes, the foundations of whose histories
were laid in truth, while the structure was reared
by fancy. The Egyptians informed Herodotus that their
deities&mdash;the last of whom was Orus son of Osiris, the
Apollo of the Grecians&mdash;were originally their kings.
Others affirm that myths are but symbolic ideas deified;
that they are but the embodiment of a maxim in the
form of an allegory, and that under these allegorical
forms were taught history, religion, law and morality.</p>

<p>Intermingled with all these hypotheses are elements
of truth, and yet none of them appear to be satisfying
explanations. All imply that religion, in some form, is
an essential constituent of humanity, and that whatever
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">21</a></span>
its origin and functions, it has exercised from the earliest
ages and does yet exercise the most powerful influence
upon man; working like leaven in the lump, keeping
the world in a ferment, stirring up men to action, banding
and disrupting nations, uniting and dividing communities,
and forming the nucleus of numberless societies
and institutions.</p>

<p class="sidenote">RISE OF THE PRIMITIVE PRIESTHOOD.</p>

<p>In every society, small and great, there are undoubtedly
certain intellects of quicker than ordinary perception,
which seize upon occasions, and by a skillful use
of means obtain a mastery over inferior minds. It is
thus that political and social, as well as ecclesiastical
power arises. Not that the leader creates a want&mdash;he
is but the mouth-piece or agent of pent-up human instincts.
One of these instincts is dependence. That
we are created subordinate, not absolute nor unrestrained,
is a fact from which none can escape. Thraldom,
constant and insurmountable, we feel we have
inherited. Most naturally, therefore, the masses of
mankind seek from among their fellows some embodiment
of power, and ranging themselves under the banner
of leaders, follow blindly whithersoever they are
led. Perceiving the power thus placed in their hands,
these born leaders of men are not slow to invent means
for retaining and increasing it. To the inquiry of the
child or unsophisticated savage, who, startled by a peal
of distant thunder, cries, "What is that?" the explanation
is given; "That is the storm-god speaking." "I
am afraid, protect me!" implores the supplicant. "I
will, only obey," is the reply. The answer is sufficient,
curiosity is satisfied, and terror allayed; the barbarian
teacher gains a devotee. In this manner, the superstructure
of creeds, witchcrafts, priestcrafts, may have
arisen; some gods may thus have been made, forms of
worship invented, and intercourse opened with beings
supernal and infernal. Then devotion advances and
becomes an art; professors by practice become experts.
Meanwhile, craft is economized; the wary Shamán rain-doctor&mdash;like
the worthy clergyman of civilized orthodoxy,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">22</a></span>
who refused to pray for rain "while the wind
was in that quarter"&mdash;watches well the gathering ripeness
of the cloud before he attempts to burst it with an
arrow. And in the end, a more than ordinary skill in
the exercise of this power, deifies or demonizes the
possessor.</p>

<p>But whence arises the necessity for craft and whence
the craft? The faculty of invention implies skill. Skill
successfully to play upon the instincts of humanity can
only be acquired through the medium of like instincts,
and although the skill be empirical, the play must be
natural. Craft alone will not suffice to satisfy the desire;
the hook must be baited with some small element
of truth before the most credulous will seize it. If
religious beliefs are the fruits of invention, how shall
we account for the strange coincidences of thought
and worship which prevail throughout all myths and
cults? Why is it that all men of every age, in
conditions diverse, and in countries widely sundered,
are found searching out the same essential facts? All
worship; nearly all have their creation-myth, their
flood-myth, their theory of origin, of distribution from
primitive centres, and of a future state. In this regard
as in many another, civilization is but an evolution of
savagism; for almost every principle of modern philosophy
there may be found in primitive times its
parallel.</p>

<p>The nature and order of supernatural conceptions are
essentially as follows: The first and rudest form of belief
is Fetichism, which invests every phenomenon with
an independent personality. In the sunshine, fire, and
water, in the wind and rock and stream, in every
animal, bird, and plant, there is a separate deity; for
every effect there is a cause. Even Kepler, whose intellect
could track the planets in their orbits, must needs
assume a guiding spirit for every world. It is impossible
for the mind to conceive of self-creative or self-existent
forces.</p>

<p>In time the personalities of the fetich-worshiper become
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">23</a></span>
to some extent generalized. Homogeneous appearances
are grouped into classes, and each class referred
to a separate deity, and hence Polytheism. Pantheism
then comes in and makes all created substance one with
the creator; nature and the universe are God. From the
impersonating of the forces of nature to the creation of
imaginary deities there is but a step. Every virtue and
vice, every good and evil becomes a personality, under
the direct governance of which lie certain passions and
events; and thus in place of one god for many individuals,
each individual may have a multitude of his own
personal gods. The theogony of Hesiod was but a system
of materialized love and hate; while, on the other
hand, the gods of Homer, although personating human
passions, were likewise endowed with moral perceptions.
In them the blind forces of nature are lighted up into a
human-divine intelligence.</p>

<p>In Monotheism the distinct personalities, which to the
savage underlie every appearance, become wholly generalized,
and the origin of all phenomena is referred to
one First Cause. The subtle and philosophic Greeks
well knew that God to be God must be omnipotent, and
omnipotency is indivisible. That the Aztecs could believe
and practice the absurdities they did is less an object
of wonder, than that the intellectual philosophers of
Athens could have tolerated the gods of Homer. Indeed,
the religion of the more cultivated Greeks appears
to us monstrous, in proportion as they were superior to
other men in poetry, art, and philosophy.</p>

<p class="sidenote">THEORIES CONCERNING THE ORIGIN OF WORSHIP.</p>

<p>Comparative mythologists explain the origin of worship
by two apparently oppugnant theories. The first is
that whatever is seen in nature strange and wonderful,
is deemed by primitive man an object worthy of
worship. The other is, that upon certain noted individuals
are fastened metaphorical names, symbolic of
some quality alike in them and in the natural object
after which they are called; that this name, which at
the first was but the surname of an individual, after its
possessor is dead and forgotten, lives, reverts to the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">24</a></span>
plant or animal whence it came, becomes impersonal,
and is worshiped by a conservative posterity. In other
words, one theory fastens upon natural phenomena,
human attributes, and worships nature under covering
of those attributes, while the other worships in the
natural object only the memory of a dead and forgotten
man. I have no doubt that in both of these hypotheses
are elements of truth.</p>

<p>In the earlier acts of worship the tendency is to
assimilate the object worshiped and the character of the
worshiper, and also to assign habitations to deities,
behind man's immediate environment. Every people
has its heaven and hell; the former most generally located
beyond the blue sky, and the latter in the dark
interior caves of the earth. Man in nature reproduces
himself; invests appearances with attributes analogous
to his own. This likeness of the supernatural to the
natural, of gods to man, is the first advance from fetichism,
but as the intellect advances anthropomorphism
declines. As one by one the nearest mysteries are
solved by science, the emptiness of superstition becomes
apparent, and the wonderless wonder is referred by the
waking mind to general laws of causation; but still clinging
to its first conceptions it places them on objects more
remote. Man fixes his eyes upon the planets, discovers
their movements, and fancies their controlling spirit also
controls his destiny; and when released by reason from
star-worship, as formerly from fetichism, again an advance
is made, always nearing the doctrine of universal
law.</p>

<p>In one tersely comprehensive sentence Clarke gives
the old view of what were called natural religions:
"They considered them, in their source, the work of
fraud; in their essence, corrupt superstitions; in their
doctrines, wholly false; in their moral tendency, absolutely
injurious; and in their result, degenerating more
and more into greater evil."</p>

<p class="sidenote">PRIESTCRAFT AND PROPITIATION.</p>

<p>And this view seems to him alike uncharitable and
unreasonable: "To assume that they are wholly evil is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">25</a></span>
disrespectful to human nature. It supposes man to be
the easy and universal dupe of fraud. But these religions
do not rest on such a sandy foundation, but on the
feeling of dependence, the sense of accountability, the
recognition of spiritual realities very near to this world
of matter, and the need of looking up and worshiping
some unseen power higher and better than ourselves.
We shall find them always feeling after God, often finding
him. We shall see that in their origin they are not
the work of priestcraft, but of human nature; in their
essence not superstitions, but religions; in their doctrines
true more frequently than false; in their moral
tendency good rather than evil. And instead of degenerating
toward something worse, they come to prepare
the way for something better."</p>

<p>The nearest case to deliberate invention of deities
was, perhaps, the promulgation as objects of worship
in primitive times of such abstractions as Hope (Spes),
Fear (Pallor), Concord (Concordia), Courage (Virtus),
etc. How far these gods were gods, however, in even
the ordinary heathen sense of the word, is doubtful. In
any case, they were but the extension of an old and existent
principle&mdash;the personification of divine aspects or
qualities; they added no more to what went before than
a new Saint or Virgin of Loretto does to the Catholic
Church.</p>

<p>"It was a favorite opinion with the Christian apologists,
Eusebius and others," says Gladstone, "that the
pagan deities represented deified men. Others consider
them to signify the powers of external nature personified.
For others they are, in many cases, impersonations
of human passions and propensities, reflected back
from the mind of man. A fourth mode of interpretation
would treat them as copies, distorted and depraved,
of a primitive system of religion given by God to man.
The Apostle St. Paul speaks of them as devils; by which
he may perhaps intend to convey that, under the names
and in connection with the worship of those deities, the
worst influences of the Evil One were at work. This
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">26</a></span>
would rather be a subjective than an objective description;
and would rather convey an account of the practical
working of a corrupted religion, than an explanation
of its origin or its early course. As between the other
four, it seems probable that they all, in various degrees
and manners, entered into the composition of the later
paganism, and also of the Homeric or Olympian system.
That system, however, was profoundly adverse to mere
Nature-worship; while the care of departments or provinces
of external nature were assigned to its leading
personages. Such worship of natural objects or elemental
powers, as prevailed in connection with it, was
in general local or secondary. And the deification of
heroes in the age of Homer was rare and merely titular.
We do not find that any cult or system of devotion was
attached to it."</p>

<p>So humanly divine, so impotently great are the gods
of Homer; so thoroughly invested with the passions of
men, clothed in distinctive shades of human character;
such mingled virtue and vice, love and hate, courage and
cowardice; animal passions uniting with noble sentiments;
base and vulgar thoughts with lofty and sublime
ideas; and all so wrought up by his inimitable
fancy into divine and supernatural beings, as to work
most powerfully upon the nature of the people.</p>

<p>These concrete conceptions of his deities have ever
been a source of consolation to the savage; for, by thus
bringing down the gods to a nearer level with himself,
they could be more materially propitiated, and their protection
purchased with gifts and sacrifices. Thus the
Greeks could obtain advice through oracles, the Hindoo
could pass at once into eternal joys by throwing himself
under the car of Juggernaut, while the latter-day offender
seeks in the assistance of the departed to buy forgiveness
with charities, and to compound crime by building
churches.</p>

<p class="sidenote">UNRECORDED FACTS SOON BECOME MYTHOLOGICAL.</p>

<p>The difficulty is, that in attempting to establish any
theory concerning the origin of things, the soundest
logic is little else than wild speculation. Mankind progress
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">27</a></span>
unconsciously. We know not what problems we
ourselves are working out for those who come after us;
we know not by what process we arrive at many of our
conclusions; much of that which is clear to ourselves is
never understood by our neighbor, and never will be
even known by our posterity. Events the most material
are soon forgotten, or else are made spiritual and preserved
as myths. Blot out the process by which science
arrived at results, and in every achievement of science,
in the steam engine, the electric telegraph, we should soon
have a heaven-descended agency, a god for every machine.
Where mythology ceases and history begins, is
in the annals of every nation a matter of dispute.
What at first appears to be wholly fabulous may contain
some truth, whereas much of what is held to be true is
mere fable, and herein excessive skepticism is as unwise
as excessive credulity.</p>

<p>Historical facts, if unrecorded, are soon lost. Thus
when Juan de Oñate penetrated New Mexico in 1596,
Fray Marco de Niza, and the expedition of Coronado in
1540, appear to have been entirely forgotten by the
Cibolans. Fathers Crespi and Junípero Serra, in their
overland explorations of 1769, preparatory to the establishment
of a line of Missions along the Californian
seaboard, could find no traces, in the minds of the natives,
of Cabrillo's voyage in 1542, or of the landing of Sir
Francis Drake in 1579; although, so impressed were the
savages in the latter instance, that, according to the worthy
chaplain of the expedition, they desired "with submission
and fear to worship us as gods." Nor can we think
civilized memories&mdash;which ascribe the plays of Shakespeare
to Bacon, and parcel out the Iliad of Homer
among numberless unrecorded verse-makers&mdash;more tenacious.
Frederick Augustus Wolf denies that a Homer
ever existed; or, if he did, that he ever wrote his poem,
as writing was at that time not generally known; but he
claims that snatches of history, descending orally from one
generation to another, in the end coalesced into the
matchless Iliad and Odyssey. The event which so
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">28</a></span>
strongly impressed the father, becomes vague in the
mind of the son, and in the third generation is either
lost or becomes legendary. Incidents of recent occurrence,
contemporary perhaps with the narration, are
sometimes so misinterpreted by ignorance or distorted
by prejudice, as to place the fact strangely at variance
with the recital. Yet no incident nor action falls purposeless
to the ground. Unrecorded it may be, unwitnessed,
unheard by beings material; a thought-wave
even, lost in space invisible, acting, for aught we know,
only upon the author; yet so acting, it casts an influence,
stamps on fleeting time its record, thereby fulfilling its
destiny. Thus linger vapory conceits long after the
action which created them has sunk into oblivion; undefined
shadows of substance departed; none the less impressive
because mingled with immortal imagery.</p>

<p>Turn now from outward events to inner life; from
events grown shadowy with time, to life ever dim and
mysterious alike to savage and sage. Everywhere man
beholds much that is incomprehensible; within, around,
the past, the future. Invisible forces are at work, invisible
agencies play upon his destiny. And in the
creations of fancy, which of necessity grow out of the
influence of nature upon the imagination, it is not
strange that mysteries darken, facts and fancies blend;
the past and the future uniting in a supernatural
present.</p>

<p>We are never content with positive knowledge. From
the earliest workings of the mind, creations of fancy
play as important a part in ethical economy as positive
perceptions. Nor does culture in any wise lessen these
fanciful creations of the intellect. In the political arena
of civilized nations, wars and revolutions for the enforcement
of opinion concerning matters beyond the
reach of positive knowledge, have equaled if they have
not exceeded wars for empire or ascendancy. In the
social and individual affairs of life we are governed
more by the ideal than by the real. On reaching the
limits of positive knowledge, reason pauses, but fancy
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">29</a></span>
overleaps the boundary, and wanders forward in an endless
waste of speculation.</p>

<p class="sidenote">RELIGIOUS AND SCIENTIFIC ULTIMATES.</p>

<p>The tendency of intellectual progress, according to
the philosophy of Herbert Spencer, is from the concrete
to the abstract, from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous,
from the knowable to the unknowable. Primordially
nothing was known; as superstitions and priestcraft
grew rank, everything became known; there was
not a problem in the natural or in the supernatural
world unsolvable by religion. Now, when some elements
of absolute knowledge are beginning to appear,
we discover, not only that little is positively known, but
that much of what has been hitherto deemed past controverting,
is, under the present régime of thought,
absolutely unknowable. Formerly ultimate religious
knowledge was attained by the very novices of religion,
and ultimate scientific knowledge was explained through
their fanatical conceptions. Not only were all the mysteries
of the material universe easily solved by the
Fathers, but heaven was measured and the phenomena
of hell minutely described. Now we are just beginning
to comprehend that ultimate facts will probably
ever remain unknowable facts, for when the present
ultimate is attained, an eternity of undiscovered truth
will still lay stretched out before the searcher. Until
the finite becomes infinite, and time lapses into eternity,
the realm of thought will remain unfilled. At present,
and until the scope of the intellect is materially enlarged,
such theories as the origin of the universe&mdash;held
by atheists to be self-existent, by pantheists to have
been self-created, and by theists to have been originated
by an external agency&mdash;must remain, as they are now
admitted to be, questions beyond even the comprehension
of the intellect. Likewise scientific ultimates&mdash;such
as the qualities of time and space, the divisibility of matter,
the co-ordination of motion and rest, the correlation
of forces, the mysteries of gravitation, light and heat&mdash;are
found to be not only not solvable, but not conceivable.
And, as with the external, so with the inward
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">30</a></span>
life; we cannot conceive the nature, nor explain the
origin and duration, of consciousness. The endless speculations
of biology and psychology only leave impressions
at once of the strength and weakness of the mind
of man; strong in empirical knowledge, impotent in
every attempt rationally to penetrate the unfathomable.
Nowhere in mythology do we find the world self-created
or self-existent. Some external agency is ever brought
in to perform the work, and in the end the structure of
the universe is resolved into its original elements.</p>

<p>Primordial man finds himself surrounded by natural
phenomena, the operations of which his intelligence is
capable of grasping but partially. Certain appetites
sharpen, at once, certain instincts. Hunger makes him
acquainted with the fruits of the earth; cold with the
skins of beasts. Accident supplies him with rude implements,
and imparts to him a knowledge of his power
over animals. But as instinct merges into intellect,
strange powers in nature are felt; invisible agents wielding
invisible weapons; realities which exist unheard and
move unseen; outward manifestations of hidden strength.
Humanity, divine, but wild and wondering, half-fed,
half-clad, ranges woods primeval, hears the roar of battling
elements, sees the ancient forest-tree shivered into
fragments by heaven's artillery, feels the solid earth rise
up in rumbling waves beneath his feet. He receives, as
it were, a blow from within the darkness, and flinging
himself upon the ground he begs protection; from what
he knows not, of whom he knows not. "Bury me not,
O tumultuous heavens," he cries, "under the clouds of
your displeasure!" "Strike me not down in wrath, O
fierce flaming fire!" "Earth, be firm!" Here, then, is
the origin of prayer. And to render more effectual his
entreaties, a gift is offered. Seizing upon whatever he
prizes most, his food, his raiment, he rushes forth and
hurls his propitiatory offering heavenward, earthward,
whithersoever his frenzied fancy dictates. Or, if this
is not enough, the still more dearly valued gift of human
blood or human life is offered. His own flesh he freely
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">31</a></span>
lacerates; to save his own life he gives that of his
enemy, his slave, or even his child. Hence arises sacrifice.</p>

<p class="sidenote">ORIGIN AND PROGRESS OF PRIESTCRAFT.</p>

<p>And here also conjurings commence. The necessity
is felt of opening up some intercourse with these mysterious
powers; relations commercial and social; calamities
and casualties, personal and public, must be traced
to causes, and the tormenting demon bought off. But it
is clearly evident that these elemental forces are not all
of them inimical to the happiness of mankind. Sunshine,
air and water, the benign influences in nature,
are as powerful to create, as the adverse elements are to
destroy. And as these forces appear conflicting, part
productive of life and enjoyment, and part of destruction,
decay, and death, a separation is made. Hence
principles of good and evil are discovered; and to all
these unaccountable forces in nature, names and properties
are given, and causations invented. For every act
there is an actor&mdash;for every deed a doer; for every
power and passion there is made a god.</p>

<p>Thus we see that worship in some form is a human
necessity, or, at least, a constant accompaniment of humanity.
Until perfect wisdom and limitless power are
the attributes of humanity, adoration will continue; for
men will never cease to reverence what they do not understand,
nor will they cease to fear such elements of
strength as are beyond their control. The form of this
conciliatory homage appears to arise from common human
instincts; for, throughout the world and in all
ages, a similarity in primitive religious forms has existed.
It is a giving of something; the barter of a valuable
something for a something more valuable. As in his
civil polity all crimes may be compounded or avenged,
so in his worship, the savage gives his pride, his property,
or his blood.</p>

<p>At first, this spirit power is seen in everything; in
the storm and in the soft evening air; in clouds and
cataracts, in mountains, rocks, and rivers; in trees, in
reptiles, beasts, and fishes. But when progressive man
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">32</a></span>
obtains a more perfect mastery over the brute creation,
brute worship ceases; as he becomes familiar with the
causes of some of the forces in nature, and is better able
to protect himself from them, the fear of natural objects
is lessened. Leaving the level of the brute creation he
mounts upward, and selecting from his own species some
living or dead hero, he endows a king or comrade with
superhuman attributes, and worships his dead fellow
as a divine being. Still he tunes his thoughts to subtler
creations, and carves with skillful fingers material images
of supernatural forms. Then comes idolatry. The great
principles of causation being determined and embodied
in perceptible forms, adorations ensue. Cravings, however,
increase. As the intellect expands, one idol after
another is thrown down. Mind assumes the mastery
over matter. From gods of wood and stone, made by
men's fingers, and from suns and planets, carved by the
fingers of omnipotence, the creature now turns to the
Creator. A form of ideal worship supplants the material
form; gods known and tangible are thrown aside
for the unknown God. And well were it for the intellect
could it stop here. But, as the actions of countless
material gods were clear to the primitive priest, and by
him satisfactorily explained to the savage masses; so, in
this more advanced state men are not wanting who receive
from their ideal god revelations of his actions and
motives. To its new, unknown, ideal god, the partially
awakened human mind attaches the positive attributes
of the old, material deities, or invents new ones, and
starts anew to tread the endless mythologic circle; until
in yet a higher state it discovers that both god and attributes
are wholly beyond its grasp, and that with all its
progress, it has advanced but slightly beyond the first
savage conception;&mdash;a power altogether mysterious, inexplicable
to science, controlling phenomena of mind
and matter.</p>

<p>Barbarians are the most religious of mortals. While
the busy, overworked brain of the scholar or man of
business is occupied with more practical affairs, the listless
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">33</a></span>
mind of the savage, thrown as he is upon the very
bosom of nature, is filled with innumerable conjectures
and interrogatories. His curiosity, like that of a child,
is proverbial, and as superstition is ever the resource of
ignorance, queer fancies and fantasms concerning life and
death, and gods and devils float continually through his
unenlightened imagination.</p>

<p>Ill-protected from the elements, his comfort and his
uncertain food-supply depending upon them, primitive
man regards nature with eager interest. Like the
beasts, his forest companions, he places himself as far as
possible in harmony with his environment. He migrates
with the seasons; feasts when food is plenty, fasts in
famine-time; basks and gambols in the sunshine, cowers
beneath the fury of the storm, crawls from the cold into
his den, and there quasi-torpidly remains until nature
releases him. Is it therefore strange that savage intellect
peoples the elements with supernatural powers; that
God is everywhere, in everything; in the most trifling
accident and incident, as well as in the sun, the sea, the
grove; that when evil comes God is angry, when fortune
smiles God is favorable; and that he speaks to his wild,
untutored people in signs and dreams, in the tempest and
in the sunshine. Nor does he withhold the still, small
voice, which breathes upon minds most darkened, and
into breasts the most savage, a spirit of progress, which,
if a people be left to the free fulfillment of their destiny,
is sure, sooner or later, to ripen into full development.</p>

<p class="sidenote">ORIGIN OF FETICHISM.</p>

<p>We will now glance at the origin of fetichism, which
indeed may be called the origin of ideal religion, from
the other standpoint; that which arises from the respect
men feel for the memory of their departed ancestors.</p>

<p>The first conception of a dualty in man's nature has
been attributed to various causes; it may be the result of
a combination of causes. There is the shadow upon
the ground, separate, yet inseparable; the reflection of
the form upon the water; the echo of the voice,
the adventures of fancy portrayed by dreams. Self
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">34</a></span>
is divisible from and inseparably connected with this
other self. Herefrom arise innumerable superstitions; it
was portentous of misfortune for one's clothes to be
stepped on; no food must be left uneaten; nail clippings
and locks of hair must not fall into the hands of an
enemy. Catlin, in sketching his portraits, often narrowly
escaped with his life, the Indians believing that in
their likenesses he carried away their other self.
And when death comes, and this other self departs,
whither has it gone? The lifeless body remains, but
where is the life? The mind cannot conceive of the
total extinguishment of an entity, and so the imagination
rears a local habitation for every departed spirit.
Every phenomenon and every event is analyzed under
this hypothesis. For every event there is not only a
cause, but a personal cause, an independent agent behind
every consequence. Every animal, every fish and bird,
every rock and stream and plant, the ripening fruit,
the falling rain, the uncertain wind, the sun and stars,
are all personified. There is no disease without its god
or devil, no fish entangled in the net, no beast or bird
that falls before the hunter, without its special sender.</p>

<p>Savages are more afraid of a dead man than a live
one. They are overwhelmed with terror at the thought
of this unseen power over them. The spirit of the departed
is omnipotent and omnipresent. At any cost or
hazard it must be propitiated. So food is placed in the
grave; wives and slaves, and horses and dogs, are slain,
and in spirit sent to serve the ghost of the departed;
phantom messengers are sent to the region of shadows
from time to time; the messengers sometimes even volunteering
to go. So boats and weapons and all the
property of the deceased are burned or deposited with
him. In the hand of the dead child is placed a toy; in
that of the departed warrior, the symbolic pipe of peace,
which is to open a tranquil entrance into his new abode;
clothes, and ornaments, and paint, are conveniently
placed, and thus a proper personal appearance guaranteed.
Not that the things themselves are to be used,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span>
but the souls of things. The body of the chief rots,
as does the material substance of the articles buried
with it; but the soul of every article follows the soul of
its owner, to serve its own peculiar end in the land of
phantoms.</p>

<p class="sidenote">THE WORSHIP OF DEAD ANCESTORS.</p>

<p>The Chinese, grown cunning with the great antiquity
of their burial customs, which require money and food
to be deposited for the benefit of the deceased, spiritualize
the money, by making an imitation coin of pasteboard,
while the food, untouched by the dead, is finally
eaten by themselves.</p>

<p>But whence arises the strange propensity of all primitive
nations to worship animals, and plants, and stones,
things animate and inanimate, natural and supernatural?
Why is it that all nations or tribes select from nature
some object which they hold to be sacred, and which
they venerate as deity? It is the opinion of Herbert
Spencer that "the rudimentary form of all religion is
the propitiation of dead ancestors, who are supposed to
be still existing, and to be capable of working good or
evil to their descendants." It is the universal custom with
savage tribes, as the character of their members becomes
developed, to drop the real name of individuals and
to fix upon them the attribute of some external object,
by whose name only they are afterwards known. Thus
a swift runner is called the 'antelope,' the slow of foot,
the 'tortoise,' a merciless warrior, the 'wolf,' a dark-eyed
maid may be likened to the 'raven,' a majestic
matron to the 'cypress.' And so the rivulet, the rock, the
dawn, the sun, and even elements invisible, are seized upon
as metaphors and fastened upon individuals, according
to a real or fancied resemblance between the qualities
of nature and the character of the men. Inferiority
and baseness, alike with nobleness and wise conduct,
perpetuate a name. Even in civilized societies, a nickname
often takes the place of the real name. Schoolboys
are quick to distinguish peculiarities in their fellows,
and fasten upon them significant names. A dull
scholar is called 'cabbage-head,' the girl with red ringlets,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">36</a></span>
'carrots.' In the family there is the greedy
'pig,' the darling 'duck,' the little 'lamb.' In new
countries, and abnormal communities, where strangers
from all parts are promiscuously thrown together, not unfrequently
men live on terms of intimacy for years without
ever knowing each other's real name. Among miners,
such appellations as 'Muley Bill,' 'Sandy,' 'Shorty,'
'Sassafras Jack,' often serve all the purposes of a name.
In more refined circles, there is the hypocritical 'crocodile,'
the sly 'fox,' the gruff 'bear.' We say of the
horse, 'he is as fleet as the wind,' of a rapid accountant,
'he is as quick as lightning.' These names, which
are used by us but for the moment, or to fit occasions,
are among rude nations permanent&mdash;in many instances
the only name a person ever receives.</p>

<p>Sometimes the nickname of the individual becomes
first a family name and then a tribal name; as when
the chief, 'Coyote,' becomes renowned, his children
love to call themselves 'Coyotes.' The chieftainship
descending to the son and grandson of Coyote, the
name becomes famous, the Coyote family the dominant
family of the tribe; members of the tribe, in their
intercourse with other tribes, call themselves 'coyotes,'
to distinguish themselves from other tribes; the head,
or tail, or claws, or skin, of the coyote ornaments the
dress or adorns the body; the name becomes tribal, and
the animal the symbol or totem of the tribe. After a
few generations have passed, the great chieftain, Coyote,
and his immediate progeny are forgotten; meanwhile
the beast becomes a favorite with the people; he begins
to be regarded as privileged; is not hunted down like
other beasts; the virtues and exploits of the whole
Coyote clan become identified with the brute; the affections
of the people are centered in the animal, and
finally, all else being lost and forgotten, the descendants
of the chieftain, Coyote, are the offspring of the veritable
beast, coyote.</p>

<p class="sidenote">ABSTRACT CONCEPTIONS, MONSTERS, AND METAPHORS.</p>

<p>Concerning image-worship and the material representation
of ideal beings, Mr. Tylor believes that "when
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">37</a></span>
man has got some way in developing the religious element
in him, he begins to catch at the device of setting up
a puppet, or a stone, as the symbol and representative of
the notions of a higher being which are floating in his
mind."</p>

<p>Primitive languages cannot express abstract qualities.
For every kind of animal or bird or plant there may be
a name, but for animals, plants, and birds in general, they
have no name or conception. Therefore, the abstract
quality becomes the concrete idea of a god, and the descendants
of a man whose symbolic name was 'dog,'
from being the children of the man become the children
of the dog.</p>

<p>Hence also arise monsters, beings compounded of
beast, bird, and fish, sphinxes, mermaids, human-headed
brutes, winged animals; as when the descendant of the
'hawk' carries off a wife from the 'salmon' tribe, a totem
representing a fish with a hawk's head for a time keeps
alive the occurrence and finally becomes the deity.</p>

<p>Thus realities become metaphors and metaphors realities;
the fact dwindles into shadowy nothingness and
the fancy springs into actual being. The historical incident
becomes first indistinct and then is forgotten; the
metaphorical name of the dead ancestor is first respected
in the animal or plant, then worshiped in the animal
or plant, and finally the nickname and the ancestor both
are forgotten and the idea becomes the entity, and the
veritable object of worship. From forgetfulness of primogenitor
and metaphor, conceiving the animal to be the
very ancestor, words are put into the animal's mouth, the
sayings of the ancestor become the sayings of the brute;
hence mythological legends of talking beasts, and birds,
and wise fishes. To one animal is attributed a miraculous
cure, to another, assistance in time of trouble; one
animal is a deceiver, another a betrayer; and thus
through their myths and metaphors we may look back
into the soul of savagism and into their soul of nature.</p>

<p>That this is the origin of some phases of fetichism
there can be no doubt; that it is the origin of all religions,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">38</a></span>
or even the only method by which animal and
plant worship originates, I do not believe. While
there are undoubtedly general principles underlying all
religious conceptions, it does not necessarily follow, that
in every instance the methods of arriving at those fundamental
principles must be identical. As with us a child
weeps over a dead mother's picture, regarding it with
fond devotion, so the dutiful barbarian son, in order the
better to propitiate the favor of his dead ancestor, sometimes
carves his image in wood or stone, which sentiment
with time lapses into idolatry. Any object which strikes
the rude fancy as analogous to the character of an individual
may become an object of worship.</p>

<p>The interpretation of myth can never be absolute and
positive; yet we may in almost every instance discover
the general purport. Thus a superior god, we may be
almost sure, refers to some potent hero, some primitive
ruler, whom tradition has made superhuman in origin and
in power; demigods, subordinate or inferior beings in
power, must be regarded as legendary, referring to certain
influential persons, identified with some element or
incident in which the deified personage played a conspicuous
part.</p>

<p>Although in mythology religion is the dominant element,
yet mythology is not wholly made up of religion,
nor are all primitive religions mythical. "There are
few mistakes" says Professor Max Müller "so widely
spread and so firmly established as that which makes us
confound the religion and the mythology of the ancient
nations of the world. How mythology arises, necessarily
and naturally, I tried to explain in my former lectures,
and we saw that, as an affection or disorder of language,
mythology may infect every part of the intellectual life
of man. True it is that no ideas are more liable to mythological
disease than religious ideas, because they
transcend those regions of our experience within which
language has its natural origin, and must therefore, according
to their very nature, be satisfied with metaphorical
expressions. Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither

hath it entered into the heart of man. Yet even the
religions of the ancient nations are by no means inevitably
and altogether mythological. On the contrary, as
a diseased frame pre-supposes a healthy frame, so a
mythological religion pre-supposes, I believe, a healthy
religion."</p>

<p class="sidenote">FUNDAMENTAL IDEAS OF RELIGION.</p>

<p>The universal secrets of supernatural beings are wrapped
up in probable or possible fable; the elements of
physical nature are impersonated in allegories, and
arrayed in forms perceptible to the imagination; deities
are sometimes introduced into the machinery of the
supernatural in order to gratify that love for the marvelous
which every attempt to explain the mysterious
forces of nature creates in the ignorant mind. Yet
it cannot truly be said that any form of religion, much
less any religion was wholly invented. Fanatics sometimes
originate doctrines, and the Church sets forth its
dogmas, but there must be a foundation of truth or the
edifice cannot stand. Inventions there undoubtedly
have been and are, but inventions, sooner or later fall
to the ground, while the essential principles underlying
religion and mythology, though momentarily overcome
or swept away, are sure to remain.</p>

<p>Every one of the fundamental ideas of religion is of
indigenous origin, generating spontaneously in the
human heart. It is a characteristic of mythology that the
present inhabitants of the world descended from some
nobler race. From the nobler impulses of fancy the
savage derives his origin. His higher instincts teach
him that his dim distant past, and his impenetrable
future, are alike of a lighter, more ethereal nature; that
his earthly nature is base, that that which binds him
to earth is the lowest, vilest part of himself.</p>

<p>The tendency of positive knowledge is to overthrow
superstition. Hence as science develops, many tenets of
established religions, palpably erroneous, are dropped, and
the more knowledge becomes real, the more real knowledge
is denied. Superstition is not the effect of an
active imagination, but shows rather a lack of imagination,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span>
for we see that the lower the stage of intelligence, and
the feebler the imagination, the greater the superstition.
A keen, vivid imagination, although capable of broader
and more complicated conceptions, is able to explain the
cruder marvels, and consequently to dispel the coarser
phases of superstition, while the dull intellect accepts
everything which is put upon it as true. Ultimate religious
conceptions are symbolic rather than actual. Ultimate
ideas of the universe are even beyond the grasp
of the profoundest intellect. We can form but an approximate
idea of the sphere on which we live. To form
conceptions of the relative and actual distances and
magnitudes of heavenly bodies, of systems of worlds, and
eternities of space, the human mind is totally inadequate.
If, therefore, the mind is unable to grasp material visible
objects, how much less are we able to measure the invisible
and eternal.</p>

<p>When therefore the savage attempts to solve the problem
of natural phenomena, he first reduces broad conceptions
to symbolic ideas. He moulds his deity according
to the measure of his mind; and in forming a skeleton
upon which to elaborate his religious instincts, proximate
theories are accepted, and almost any explanation appears
to him plausible. The potential creations of his
fancy are brought within the compass of his comprehension;
symbolic gods are moulded from mud, or carved
from wood or stone; and thus by segregating an infinitesimal
part of the vast idea of deity, the worshiper
meets the material requirements of his religious conceptions.
And although the lower forms of worship are
abandoned as the intellect unfolds, the same principle
is continued. We set up in the mind symbols of the ultimate
idea which is too great for our grasp, and imagining
ourselves in possession of the actual idea, we fall into
numberless errors concerning what we believe or think.
The atheistic hypothesis of self-existence, the pantheistic
hypothesis of self-creation, and the theistic hypothesis of
creation by an external agency are equally unthinkable,
and therefore as postulates equally untenable. Yet underlying
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">41</a></span>
all, however gross or superstitious the dogma,
is one fundamental truth, namely, that there is a problem
to be solved, an existent mysterious universe to be
accounted for.</p>

<p>Deep down in every human breast is implanted a
religiosity as a fundamental attribute of man's nature;
a consciousness that behind visible appearances is an invisible
power; underlying all conception is an instinct
or intuition from which there is no escape, that beyond
material actualities potential agencies are at work; and
throughout all belief, from the stupidest fetichism to the
most exalted monotheism, as part of these instinctive convictions,
it is held that the beings, or being, who rule
man's destiny may be propitiated.</p>

<p>The first cry of nature is hushed. From time immemorial
nations and peoples have come and gone,
whence and whither no one knows; entering existence
unannounced they disappear and leave no trace, save
perhaps their impress on the language or the mythology
of the world. Thus from historic fact blended with the
religious sentiments springs the Mythic Idea.</p>

<p class="sidenote p2">CLASSIFICATION OF PACIFIC STATES' MYTHS.</p>

<p class="p2">In the following chapters, I have attempted, as far as
practicable, to classify the Myths of the Pacific States
under appropriate heads. In making such a classification
there is no difficulty, except where in one myth occur
two or more divisions of the subject, in which case it
becomes necessary, either to break the narrative, or
make exceptions in the general rule of classifying. I
have invariably adopted the latter alternative. The
divisions which I make of Mythology are as follows: I.
Origin and End of Things; II. Physical Myths; III.
Animal Myths; IV. Gods, Supernatural Beings, and
Worship; V. The Future State.

<p class="sidenote">THE POPOL VUH.</p>

<p>Of all American peoples the Quichés, of Guatemala,
have left us the richest mythological legacy. Their
description of the creation as given in the Popol Vuh,
which may be called the national book of the Quichés,<a id="FNanchor_II-1" href="#Footnote_II-1" class="fnanchor">[II-1]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">43</a></span>
is, in its rude strange eloquence and poetic originality,
one of the rarest relics of aboriginal thought. Although
obliged in reproducing it to condense somewhat, I have
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">44</a></span>
endeavored to give not only the substance, but also, as
far as possible, the peculiar style and phraseology of the
original. It is with this primeval picture, whose simple
silent sublimity is that of the inscrutable past, that we
begin:&mdash;</p>

<p>And the heaven was formed, and all the signs thereof
set in their angle and alignment, and its boundaries fixed
towards the four winds by the Creator and Former, and
Mother and Father of life and existence&mdash;he by whom
all move and breathe, the Father and Cherisher of the
peace of nations and of the civilization of his people&mdash;he
whose wisdom has projected the excellence of all that
is on the earth, or in the lakes, or in the sea.</p>

<p>Behold the first word and the first discourse. There
was as yet no man, nor any animal, nor bird, nor fish,
nor crawfish, nor any pit, nor ravine, nor green herb,
nor any tree; nothing was but the firmament. The face
of the earth had not yet appeared&mdash;only the peaceful sea
and all the space of heaven. There was nothing yet
joined together, nothing that clung to anything else; nothing
that balanced itself, that made the least rustling,
that made a sound in the heaven. There was nothing
that stood up; nothing but the quiet water, but the sea,
calm and alone in its boundaries: nothing existed; nothing
but immobility and silence, in the darkness, in the
night.<a id="FNanchor_II-2" href="#Footnote_II-2" class="fnanchor">[II-2]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">45</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE QUICHÉ IDEA OF CREATION.</p>

<p>Alone also the Creator, the Former, the Dominator,
the Feathered Serpent&mdash;those that engender, those
that give being, they are upon the water, like a
growing light. They are enveloped in green and
blue; and therefore their name is Gucumatz.<a id="FNanchor_II-3" href="#Footnote_II-3" class="fnanchor">[II-3]</a> Lo,
now how the heavens exist, how exists also the
Heart of Heaven; such is the name of God; it is
thus that he is called. And they spake; they consulted
together and meditated; they mingled their words
and their opinion. And the creation was verily after
this wise: Earth, they said, and on the instant it was
formed; like a cloud or a fog was its beginning. Then
the mountains rose over the water like great lobsters;
in an instant the mountains and the plains were visible,
and the cypress and the pine appeared. Then was the
Gucumatz filled with joy, crying out: Blessed be thy
coming, O Heart of Heaven, Hurakan, Thunderbolt.
Our work and our labor has accomplished its end.</p>

<p>The earth and its vegetation having thus appeared, it
was peopled with the various forms of animal life. And
the Makers said to the animals: Speak now our name,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">46</a></span>
honor us, us your mother and father; invoke Hurakan,
the Lightning-flash, the Thunderbolt that strikes, the
Heart of Heaven, the Heart of the Earth, the Creator and
Former, Him who begets, and Him who gives being&mdash;speak,
call on us, salute us! So was it said to the animals.
But the animals could not answer; they could not speak
at all after the manner of men; they could only cluck,
and croak, each murmuring after his kind in a different
manner. This displeased the Creators, and they said to
the animals: Inasmuch as ye can not praise us, neither
call upon our names, your flesh shall be humiliated; it
shall be broken with teeth; ye shall be killed and eaten.</p>

<p>Again the gods took counsel together; they determined
to make man. So they made a man of clay; and when
they had made him, they saw that it was not good. He
was without cohesion, without consistence, motionless,
strengthless, inept, watery; he could not move his head,
his face looked but one way; his sight was restricted, he
could not look behind him; he had been endowed with
language, but he had no intelligence, so he was consumed
in the water.</p>

<p>Again is there counsel in heaven: Let us make
an intelligent being who shall adore and invoke us.
It was decided that a man should be made of wood
and a woman of a kind of pith. They were made; but
the result was in no wise satisfactory. They moved
about perfectly well, it is true; they increased and multiplied;
they peopled the world with sons and daughters,
little wooden mannikins like themselves; but still the
heart and the intelligence were wanting; they held no
memory of their Maker and Former; they led a useless
existence, they lived as the beasts live; they forgot the
Heart of Heaven. They were but an essay, an attempt
at men; they had neither blood, nor substance, nor
moisture, nor fat; their cheeks were shrivelled, their feet
and hands dried up; their flesh languished.</p>

<p class="sidenote">DESTRUCTION AND RE-CREATION OF MAN.</p>

<p>Then was the Heart of Heaven wroth; and he sent
ruin and destruction upon those ingrates; he rained upon
them night and day from heaven with a thick resin;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">47</a></span>
and the earth was darkened. And the men went mad
with terror; they tried to mount upon the roofs and the
houses fell; they tried to climb the trees and the trees
shook them far from their branches; they tried to hide
in the caves and dens of the earth, but these closed their
holes against them. The bird Xecotcovach came to tear
out their eyes; and the Camalotz cut off their head; and
the Cotzbalam devoured their flesh; and the Tecumbalam
broke and bruised their bones to powder. Thus
were they all devoted to chastisement and destruction,
save only a few who were preserved as memorials of the
wooden men that had been; and these now exist in the
woods as little apes.<a id="FNanchor_II-4" href="#Footnote_II-4" class="fnanchor">[II-4]</a></p>

<p>Once more are the gods in counsel; in the darkness,
in the night of a desolated universe do they commune together;
of what shall we make man? And the Creator
and Former made four perfect men; and wholly of
yellow and white maize was their flesh composed. These
were the names of the four men that were made: the
name of the first was Balam-Quitzé; of the second, Balam-Agab;
of the third Mahucutah; and of the fourth, Iqi-Balam.<a id="FNanchor_II-5" href="#Footnote_II-5" class="fnanchor">[II-5]</a>
They had neither father nor mother, neither
were they made by the ordinary agents in the work of
creation; but their coming into existence was a miracle
extraordinary, wrought by the special intervention of
him who is preëminently The Creator. Verily, at last,
were there found men worthy of their origin and their
destiny; verily, at last, did the gods look on beings who
could see with their eyes, and handle with their hands,
and understand with their hearts. Grand of countenance
and broad of limb the four sires of our race stood
up under the white rays of the morning star&mdash;sole light
as yet of the primeval world&mdash;stood up and looked.
Their great clear eyes swept rapidly over all; they saw
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">48</a></span>
the woods and the rocks, the lakes and the sea, the
mountains and the valleys, and the heavens that were
above all; and they comprehended all and admired exceedingly.
Then they returned thanks to those who had
made the world and all that therein was: We offer up
our thanks, twice&mdash;yea verily, thrice! We have received
life; we speak, we walk, we taste; we hear and understand;
we know both that which is near and that which
is far off; we see all things, great and small, in all the
heaven and earth. Thanks then, Maker and Former,
Father and Mother of our life! we have been created;
we are.</p>

<p>But the gods were not wholly pleased with this thing;
Heaven they thought had overshot its mark; these men
were too perfect; knew, understood, and saw too much.
Therefore there was counsel again in heaven: What shall
we do with man now? It is not good, this that we see;
these are as gods; they would make themselves equal
with us; lo, they know all things, great and small. Let
us now contract their sight, so that they may see only a
little of the surface of the earth and be content. Thereupon
the Heart of Heaven breathed a cloud over the
pupil of the eyes of men, and a veil came over it as
when one breathes on the face of a mirror; thus was the
globe of the eye darkened; neither was that which was
far off clear to it any more, but only that which was near.</p>

<p>Then the four men slept, and there was counsel in
heaven: and four women were made&mdash;to Balam-Quitzé
was allotted Caha-Paluma to wife; to Balam-Agab,
Chomiha; to Mahucutah, Tzununiha; and to Iqi-Balam,
Cakixaha.<a id="FNanchor_II-6" href="#Footnote_II-6" class="fnanchor">[II-6]</a> Now the women were exceedingly fair to
look upon; and when the men awoke, their hearts were
glad because of the women.</p>

<p class="sidenote">THE QUICHÉS SET OUT FOR TULAN-ZUIVA.</p>

<p>Next, as I interpret the narrative, there were other
men created, the ancestors of other peoples, while the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">49</a></span>
first four were the fathers of all the branches of the
Quiché race. The different tribes at first, however, lived
together amicably enough, in a primitive state; and increased
and multiplied, leading happy lives under their
bright and morning star, precursor of the yet unseen sun.
They had as yet no worship save the breathing of the
instinct of their soul, as yet no altars to the gods;
only&mdash;and is there not a whole idyl in the simple words?&mdash;only
they gazed up into heaven, not knowing what they
had come so far to do!<a id="FNanchor_II-7" href="#Footnote_II-7" class="fnanchor">[II-7]</a> They were filled with love,
with obedience, and with fear; and lifting their eyes towards
heaven, they made their requests:&mdash;</p>

<p>Hail! O Creator, O Former! thou that hearest and
understandest us! abandon us not, forsake us not! O
God, thou that art in heaven and on the earth, O Heart
of Heaven, O Heart of Earth! give us descendants and a
posterity as long as the light endure. Give us to walk
always in an open road, in a path without snares; to
lead happy, quiet, and peaceable lives, free of all reproach.
It was thus they spake, living tranquilly, invoking the
return of the light, waiting the rising of the sun, watching
the star of the morning, precursor of the sun. But
no sun came, and the four men and their descendants
grew uneasy: We have no person to watch over us, they
said, nothing to guard our symbols. So the four men and
their people set out for Tulan-Zuiva,<a id="FNanchor_II-8" href="#Footnote_II-8" class="fnanchor">[II-8]</a> otherwise called
the Seven-caves or Seven-ravines, and there they received
gods, each man as head of a family, a god; though
inasmuch as the fourth man, Iqi-Balam, had no children
and founded no family, his god is not usually taken into
the account. Balam-Quitzé received the god Tohil; Balam
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">50</a></span>
Agab received the god Avilix; and Mahucutah received
the god Hacavitz; all very powerful gods, but Tohil
seems to have been the chief, and in a general way, god
of the whole Quiché nation. Other people received gods
at the same time; and it had been for all a long march
to Tulan.</p>

<p>Now the Quichés had as yet no fire, and as Tulan
was a much colder climate than the happy eastern land
they had left, they soon began to feel the want of it.
The god Tohil who was the creator of fire had some in his
possession; so to him, as was most natural, the Quichés
applied, and Tohil in some way supplied them with fire.</p>

<p>But shortly after, there fell a great rain that extinguished
all the fires of the land; and much hail also fell
on the heads of the people; and because of the rain and
the hail, their fires were utterly scattered and put out.
Then Tohil created fire again by stamping with his
sandal. Several times thus fire failed them, but Tohil
always renewed it. Many other trials also they underwent
in Tulan, famines and such things, and a general
dampness and cold&mdash;for the earth was moist, there being
as yet no sun.</p>

<p>Here also the language of all the families was confused
so that no one of the first four men could any longer understand
the speech of another. This also made them
very sad. They determined to leave Tulan; and the
greater part of them, under the guardianship and direction
of Tohil, set out to see where they should take up their
abode. They continued on their way amid the most
extreme hardships for want of food; sustaining themselves
at one time upon the mere smell of their staves,
and by imagining that they were eating, when in verity
and in truth, they ate nothing. Their heart, indeed, it
is again and again said, was almost broken by affliction.
Poor wanderers! they had a cruel way to go, many forests
to pierce, many stern mountains to overpass and a
long passage to make through the sea, along the shingle
and pebbles and drifted sand&mdash;the sea being, however,
parted for their passage.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">QUICHÉ ORIGIN OF THE SUN.</p>

<p>At last they came to a mountain that they named
Hacavitz, after one of their gods, and here they rested&mdash;for
here they were by some means given to understand
that they should see the sun. Then indeed, was filled
with an exceeding joy the heart of Balam-Quitzé, of
Balam-Agab, of Mahucutah, and of Iqi-Balam. It seemed
to them that even the face of the morning star caught a
new and more resplendent brightness. They shook their
incense pans and danced for very gladness: sweet were
their tears in dancing, very hot their incense&mdash;their precious
incense. At last the sun commenced to advance:
the animals, small and great, were full of delight; they
raised themselves to the surface of the water; they fluttered
in the ravines; they gathered at the edge of the
mountains, turning their heads together toward that
part from which the sun came. And the lion and the
tiger roared. And the first bird that sang was that called
the Queletzu. All the animals were beside themselves at
the sight; the eagle and the kite beat their wings, and
every bird, both small and great. The men prostrated
themselves on the ground, for their hearts were full to
the brim.</p>

<p>And the sun, and the moon, and the stars were now
all established. Yet was not the sun then in the beginning
the same as now; his heat wanted force, and he
was but as a reflection in a mirror; verily, say the histories,
not at all the same sun as that of to-day. Nevertheless
he dried up and warmed the surface of the earth,
and answered many good ends.</p>

<p>Another wonder when the sun rose! The three tribal
gods, Tohil, Avilix, and Hacavitz, were turned into stone,
as were also the gods connected with the lion, the tiger,
the viper, and other fierce and dangerous animals. Perhaps
we should not be alive at this moment&mdash;continues
the chronicle&mdash;because of the voracity of these fierce animals,
of these lions, and tigers, and vipers; perhaps to-day
our glory would not be in existence, had not the sun
caused this petrification.</p>

<p>And the people multiplied on this Mount Hacavitz,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">52</a></span>
and here they built their city. It is here also that they
began to sing that song called Kamucu, 'we see.' They
sang it, though it made their hearts ache, for this is what
they said in singing: Alas! We ruined ourselves in
Tulan, there lost we many of our kith and kin, they still
remain there, left behind! We indeed have seen the
sun, but they&mdash;now that his golden light begins to appear,
where are they?</p>

<p>And they worshiped the gods that had become stone,
Tohil, Avilix, and Hacavitz; and they offered them the
blood of beasts, and of birds, and pierced their own ears
and shoulders in honor of these gods, and collected the
blood with a sponge, and pressed it out into a cup before
them.</p>

<p>Toward the end of their long and eventful life Balam-Quitzé,
Balam-Agab, Mahucutah, and Iqi-Balam
were impelled, apparently by a supernatural vision, to
lay before their gods a more awful offering than the life
of senseless beasts. They began to wet their altars
with the heart's blood of human victims. From their
mountain hold they watched for lonely travelers belonging
to the surrounding tribes, seized, overpowered, and
slew them for a sacrifice. Man after man was missing in
the neighboring villages; and the people said: Lo! the
tigers have carried them away&mdash;for wherever the blood
was of a man slain, were always found the tracks of
many tigers. Now this was the craft of the priests, and
at last the tribes began to suspect the thing and to follow
the tracks of the tigers. But the trails had been
made purposely intricate, by steps returning on themselves
and by the obliteration of steps; and the mountain
region where the altars were was already covered
with a thick fog and a small rain, and its paths flowed
with mud.</p>

<p>The hearts of the villagers were thus fatigued within
them, pursuing unknown enemies. At last, however, it
became plain that the gods Tohil, Avilix and Hacavitz,
and their worship, were in some way or other the cause
of this bereavement: so the people of the villages conspired
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">53</a></span>
against them. Many attacks, both openly and
by ruses, did they make on the gods, and on the four
men, and on the children and people connected with
them; but not once did they succeed, so great was the
wisdom, and power, and courage of the four men and of
their deities. And these three gods petrified, as we
have told, could nevertheless resume a movable shape
when they pleased; which indeed they often did, as will
be seen hereafter.</p>

<p>At last the war was finished. By the miraculous aid
of a horde of wasps and hornets, the Quichés utterly defeated
and put to the rout in a general battle all their
enemies. And the tribes humiliated themselves before
the face of Balam-Quitzé, of Balam-Agab, and of Mahucutah:
Unfortunates that we are, they said, spare to us
at least our lives. Let it be so, it was answered, although
you be worthy of death; you shall, however, be
our tributaries and serve us, as long as the sun endure,
as long as the light shall follow his course. This was
the reply of our fathers and mothers, upon Mount Hacavitz;
and thereafter they lived in great honor and
peace, and their souls had rest, and all the tribes served
them there.</p>

<p class="sidenote">THE END OF THE QUICHÉ CREATION.</p>

<p>Now it came to pass that the time of the death of
Balam-Quitzé, Balam-Agab, Mahucutah, and Iqi-Balam
drew near. No bodily sickness nor suffering came upon
them; but they were forewarned that their death and
their end was at hand. Then they called their sons
and their descendants round them to receive their last
counsels.</p>

<p>And the heart of the old men was rent within them.
In the anguish of their heart they sang the Kamucu,
the old sad song that they had sung when the sun first
rose, when the sun rose and they thought of the friends
they had left in Tulan, whose face they should see
no more forever. Then they took leave of their
wives, one by one; and of their sons, one by one; of
each in particular they took leave; and they said:
We return to our people; already the King of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">54</a></span>
Stags is ready, he stretches himself through the heaven.
Lo, we are about to return; our work is done; the days
of our life are complete. Remember us well; let us
never pass from your memory. You will see still our
houses and our mountains; multiply in them, and then
go on upon your way and see again the places whence we
are come.</p>

<p>So the old men took leave of their sons and of their
wives; and Balam-Quitzé spake again: Behold! he said,
I leave you what shall keep me in remembrance. I
have taken leave of you&mdash;and am filled with sadness,
he added. Then instantly the four old men were not;
but in their place was a great bundle; and it was never
unfolded, neither could any man find seam therein on
rolling it over and over. So it was called the Majesty
Enveloped; and it became a memorial of these fathers,
and was held very dear and precious in the sight of the
Quichés; and they burned incense before it.<a id="FNanchor_II-9" href="#Footnote_II-9" class="fnanchor">[II-9]</a></p>

<p>Thus died and disappeared on Mount Hacavitz Balam-Quitzé,
Balam-Agab, Mahucutah, and Iqi-Balam, these
first men who came from the east, from the other side of
the sea. Long time had they been here when they
died; and they were very old, and surnamed the Venerated
and the Sacrificers.</p>

<p class="p2">Such is the Quiché account of the creation of the
earth and its inhabitants and of the first years of the
existence of mankind. Although we find here described
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">55</a></span>
in the plainest and least equivocal terms a supreme, all-powerful
Creator of all things, there are joined with
him in a somewhat perplexing manner a number of
auxiliary deities and makers. It may be that those
whose faith the Popol Vuh represents, conceiving and
speaking of their supreme god under many aspects and
as fulfilling many functions, came at times, either unconsciously
or for dramatic effect, to bring this one
great Being upon their mythic stage, sustaining at once
many of his different parts and characters. Or perhaps,
like the Hebrews, they believed that the Creator
had made out of nothing or out of his own essence, in
some mysterious way, angels and other beings to obey
and to assist him in his sovereign designs, and that
these 'were called gods.' That these Quiché notions
seem foolishness to us, is no argument as to their adaptation
to the life and thoughts of those who believed them;
for, in the words of Professor Max Müller, "the thoughts
of primitive humanity were not only different from our
thoughts, but different also from what we think their
thoughts ought to have been."<a id="FNanchor_II-10" href="#Footnote_II-10" class="fnanchor">[II-10]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">MEXICAN COSMOGONY.</p>

<p>Yet whatever be the inconsistencies that obscure
the Popol Vuh, we find them multiplied in the
Mexican cosmogony, a tangled string of meagre and
apparently fragmentary traditions. There appear to
have been two principal schools of opinion in
Anáhuac, differing as to who was the Creator of
the world, as well as on other points&mdash;two veins of
tradition, perhaps of common origin, which often seem
to run into one, and are oftener still considered as one
by historians to whom these heathen vanities were matters
of little importance. The more advanced school,
ascribing its inspiration to Toltec sources, seems to have
flourished notably in Tezcuco, especially while the famous
Nezahualcoyotl reigned there, and to have had
very definite monotheistic ideas. It taught, as is
asserted in unmistakable terms, that all things had been
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">56</a></span>
made by one God, omnipotent and invisible; and to
this school were probably owing the many gentle and
beautiful ideas and rites, mingled with the hard, coarse,
and prosaic cult of the mass of the people.<a id="FNanchor_II-11" href="#Footnote_II-11" class="fnanchor">[II-11]</a></p>

<p>The other school may be considered as more distinctively
national, and as representing more particularly
the ordinary Mexican mind. To it is to be ascribed by
far the larger part of all we know about the Mexican
religion.<a id="FNanchor_II-12" href="#Footnote_II-12" class="fnanchor">[II-12]</a> According to the version of this school, Tezcatlipoca,
a god whose birth and adventures are set
forth hereafter, was the creator of the material heaven
and earth, though not of mankind; and sometimes even
the honor of this partial creation is disputed by others
of the gods.</p>

<p>One Mexican nation, again, according to an ancient
writer of their own blood, affirmed that the earth had
been created by chance; and as for the heavens, they had
always existed.<a id="FNanchor_II-13" href="#Footnote_II-13" class="fnanchor">[II-13]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">57</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">CHIMALPOPOCA MANUSCRIPT.</p>

<p>From the fragments of the Chimalpopoca manuscript
given by the Abbé Brasseur de Bourbourg we learn that
the Creator&mdash;whoever he may have been&mdash;produced his
work in successive epochs. In the sign Tochtli, the
earth was created; in the sign Acatl was made the firmament,
and in the sign Tecpatl the animals. Man it is
added, was made and animated out of ashes or dust by
God on the seventh day, Ehecatl, but finished and perfected
by that mysterious personage Quetzalcoatl.
However this account may be reconciled with itself or
with others, it further appears that man was four times
made and four times destroyed.<a id="FNanchor_II-14" href="#Footnote_II-14" class="fnanchor">[II-14]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">58</a></span></p>

<p>This may perhaps be looked upon as proceeding from
what I have called for convenience the Toltecan school,
though this particular fragment shows traces of Christian
influence. What follows seems however to belong to
a distinctively Mexican and ruder vein of thought. It
is gathered from Mendieta, who was indebted again to
Fray Andres de Olmos, one of the earliest missionaries
among the Mexicans of whom he treats; and it is decidedly
one of the most authentic accounts of such matters
extant.</p>

<p class="sidenote">AZTEC CREATION-MYTHS.</p>

<p>The Mexicans in most of the provinces were agreed
that there was a god in heaven called Citlalatonac, and
a goddess called Citlalicue;<a id="FNanchor_II-15" href="#Footnote_II-15" class="fnanchor">[II-15]</a> and that this goddess had
given birth to a flint knife, Tecpatl. Now she had many
sons living with her in heaven, who seeing this extraordinary
thing were alarmed, and flung the flint down to
the earth. It fell in a place called Chicomoztoc, that
is to say the Seven Caves, and there immediately
sprang up from it one thousand six hundred gods.
These gods being alone on the earth&mdash;though as will
hereafter appear, there had been men in the world at
a former period&mdash;sent up their messenger Tlotli,
the Hawk, to pray their mother to empower them
to create men, so that they might have servants as became
their lineage. Citlalicue seemed to be a little
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">59</a></span>
ashamed of these sons of hers, born in so strange a
manner, and she twitted them cruelly enough on what
they could hardly help: Had you been what you ought to
have been, she exclaimed, you would still be in my company.
Nevertheless she told them what to do in the matter
of obtaining their desire: Go beg of Mictlanteuctli,
Lord of Hades, that he may give you a bone or some ashes
of the dead that are with him; which having received
you shall sacrifice over it, sprinkling blood from your
own bodies. And the fallen gods having consulted together,
sent one of their number, called Xolotl,<a id="FNanchor_II-16" href="#Footnote_II-16" class="fnanchor">[II-16]</a> down
to hades as their mother had advised. He succeeded
in getting a bone of six feet long from Mictlanteuctli;
and then, wary of his grisly host, he took an abrupt departure,
running at the top of his speed. Wroth at this,
the infernal chief gave chase; not causing to Xolotl, however,
any more serious inconvenience than a hasty fall
in which the bone was broken in pieces. The messenger
gathered up what he could in all haste, and despite
his stumble made his escape. Reaching the earth,
he put the fragments of bone into a basin, and all the
gods drew blood from their bodies and sprinkled it into
the vessel. On the fourth day there was a movement
among the wetted bones and a boy lay there before all;
and in four days more, the blood-letting and sprinkling
being still kept up, a girl was lifted from the ghastly
dish. The children were given to Xolotl to bring up;
and he fed them on the juice of the maguey.<a id="FNanchor_II-17" href="#Footnote_II-17" class="fnanchor">[II-17]</a> Increasing
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">60</a></span>
in stature, they became man and woman; and from
them are the people of the present day descended, who,
even as the primordial bone was broken into unequal
pieces, vary in size and shape. The name of this first
man was Iztacmixcuatl, and the name of his wife Ilancueitl,<a id="FNanchor_II-18" href="#Footnote_II-18" class="fnanchor">[II-18]</a>
and they had six sons born to them, whose descendants,
with their god-masters, in process of time
moved eastward from their original home, almost universally
described as having been towards Jalisco.</p>

<p>Now there had been no sun in existence for many
years; so the gods being assembled in a place called
Teotihuacan, six leagues from Mexico, and gathered at
the time round a great fire, told their devotees that he
of them who should first cast himself into that fire,
should have the honor of being transformed into a sun.
So one of them called Nanahuatzin&mdash;either as most
say, out of pure bravery, or as Sahagun relates, because
his life had become a burden to him through a syphilitic
disease&mdash;flung himself into the fire. Then the gods
began to peer through the gloom in all directions for the
expected light and to make bets as to what part of
heaven he should first appear in. And some said Here,
and some said There; but when the sun rose they were
all proved wrong, for not one of them had fixed upon the
east.<a id="FNanchor_II-19" href="#Footnote_II-19" class="fnanchor">[II-19]</a> And in that same hour, though they knew it
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">61</a></span>
not, the decree went forth that they should all die by
sacrifice.</p>

<p class="sidenote">HOW THE SUN WAS PLACED IN THE HEAVENS.</p>

<p>The sun had risen indeed, and with a glory of the
cruel fire about him that not even the eyes of the gods
could endure; but he moved not. There he lay on the
horizon; and when the deities sent Tlotli their messenger
to him, with orders that he should go on upon his way,
his ominous answer was, that he would never leave that
place till he had destroyed and put an end to them all.
Then a great fear fell upon some, while others were moved
only to anger; and among the latter was one Citli, who immediately
strung his bow and advanced against the glittering
enemy. By quickly lowering his head the Sun
avoided the first arrow shot at him; but the second and
third had attained his body in quick succession, when,
filled with fury, he seized the last and launched it back
upon his assailant. And the brave Citli laid shaft to
string nevermore, for the arrow of the sun pierced his
forehead.</p>

<p>Then all was dismay in the assembly of the gods, and
despair filled their heart, for they saw that they could
not prevail against the shining one; and they agreed to
die, and to cut themselves open through the breast.
Xolotl was appointed minister, and he killed his
companions one by one, and last of all he slew himself
also.<a id="FNanchor_II-20" href="#Footnote_II-20" class="fnanchor">[II-20]</a> So they died like gods; and each left to the sad
and wondering men who were his servants, his garments
for a memorial. And these servants made up, each
party, a bundle of the raiment that had been left to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">62</a></span>
them, binding it about a stick into which they had bedded
a small green stone to serve as a heart. These bundles
were called <i>tlaquimilloli</i>, and each bore the name of
that god whose memorial it was; and these things were
more reverenced than the ordinary gods of stone and
wood of the country. Fray Andres de Olmos found one
of these relics in Tlalmanalco, wrapped up in many
cloths, and half rotten with being kept hid so long.<a id="FNanchor_II-21" href="#Footnote_II-21" class="fnanchor">[II-21]</a></p>

<p>Immediately on the death of the gods the sun began
his motion in the heavens; and a man called Tecuzistecatl,
or Tezcociztecatl, who, when Nanahuatzin
leaped into the fire, had retired into a cave, now
emerged from his concealment as the moon. Others
say that instead of going into a cave, this Tecuzistecatl,
had leaped into the fire after Nanahuatzin,
but that, the heat of the fire being somewhat abated,
he had come out less brilliant than the sun. Still
another variation is, that the sun and moon came
out equally bright, but this not seeming good to the gods,
one of them took a rabbit by the heels and slung it into
the face of the moon, dimming its lustre with a blotch
whose mark may be seen to this day.</p>

<p>After the gods had died in the way herein related,
leaving their garments behind as relics, those servants
went about everywhere, bearing these relics like bundles
upon their shoulders, very sad and pensive and wondering
if ever again they would see their departed gods.
Now the name of one of these deceased deities was Tezcatlipoca,
and his servant having arrived at the sea
coast, was favored with an apparition of his master in
three different shapes. And Tezcatlipoca spake to his
servant saying: Come hither, thou that lovest me so well,
that I may tell thee what thou hast to do. Go now to
the House of the Sun and fetch thence singers and instruments
so that thou mayest make me a festival; but
first call upon the whale, and upon the siren, and upon
the tortoise, and they shall make thee a bridge to the sun.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">63</a></span></p>

<p>Then was all this done; and the messenger went
across the sea upon his living bridge, towards the House
of the Sun, singing what he had to say. And the Sun
heard the song, and he straitly charged his people and
servants, saying: See now that ye make no response to
this chant, for whoever replies to it must be taken away
by the singer. But the song was so exceeding sweet
that some of them could not but answer, and they were
lured away, bearing with them the drum, <i>teponaztli</i>, and
the kettle-drum, <i>vevetl</i>. Such was the origin of the
festivals and the dances to the gods; and the songs sung
during these dances they held as prayers, singing them
always with great accuracy of intonation and time.</p>

<p class="sidenote">THE TEZCUCAN ACCOUNT OF THE CREATION.</p>

<p>In their oral traditions, the Tezcucans agreed with the
usual Mexican account of creation&mdash;the falling of the
flint from heaven to earth, and so on&mdash;but what they afterward
showed in a picture, and explained to Fray Andres
de Olmos as the manner of the creation of mankind, was
this: The event took place in the land of Aculma, on
the Tezcucan boundary at a distance of two leagues from
Tezcuco and of five from Mexico. It is said that the
sun, being at the hour of nine, cast a dart into the earth
at the place we have mentioned and made a hole; from
this hole a man came out, the first man and somewhat
imperfect withal, as there was no more of him than from
the arm-pits up, much like the conventional European
cherub, only without wings. After that the woman
came up out of the hole. The rest of the story was not
considered proper for printing by Mendieta; but at any
rate from these two are mankind descended. The name
of the first man was Aculmaitl&mdash;that is to say, <i>aculli</i>,
shoulder, and <i>maitl</i>, hand or arm&mdash;and from him the
town of Aculma is said to take its name.<a id="FNanchor_II-22" href="#Footnote_II-22" class="fnanchor">[II-22]</a> And this etymology
seems to make it probable that the details of this
myth are derived, to some extent, from the name of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">64</a></span>
place in which it was located; or that the name of the
first man belonging to an early phase of the language,
has been misunderstood, and that to the false etymology
the details of the myth are owing.</p>

<p>As already stated there had been men on the earth
previous to that final and perfect creation of man from
the bone supplied by Mictlanteuctli, and wetted by the
gods with their own blood at the place of the Seven
Caves. These men had been swept away by a succession
of great destructions. With regard to the number of
these destructions it is hard to speak positively, as on no
single point in the wide range of early American religion,
does there exist so much difference of opinion. All
the way from twice to five times, following different
accounts, has the world been desolated by tremendous
convulsions of nature. I follow most closely the version
of the Tezcucan historian Ixtlilxochitl, as being one of
the earliest accounts, as, prima facie, from its origin,
one of the most authentic, and as being supported by a
majority of respectable historians up to the time of Humboldt.</p>

<p class="sidenote">THE AGES OR SUNS OF THE MEXICANS.</p>

<p>Of the creation which ushered in the first age we know
nothing; we are only told by Boturini, that giants then
began to appear on the earth. This First Age; or 'sun,'
was called the Sun of the Water, and it was ended by
a tremendous flood in which every living thing perished,
or was transformed, except, following some accounts, one
man and one woman of the giant race, of whose escape
more hereafter. The Second Age, called the Sun of
the Earth, was closed with earthquakes, yawnings of the
earth, and the overthrow of the highest mountains.
Giants, or Quinamés, a powerful and haughty race still
appear to be the only inhabitants of the world. The
Third Age was the Sun of the Air. It was ended by
tempests and hurricanes, so destructive that few indeed
of the inhabitants of the earth were left; and those
that were saved, lost, according to the Tlascaltec account,
their reason and speech, becoming monkeys.</p>

<p>The present is the Fourth Age. To it appear to belong
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">65</a></span>
the falling of the goddess-born flint from heaven,
the birth of the sixteen hundred heroes from that flint,
the birth of mankind from the bone brought from hades,
the transformation of Nanahuatzin into the sun, the transformation
of Tezcatecatl into the moon, and the death of
the sixteen hundred heroes or gods. It is called the
Sun of Fire, and is to be ended by a universal conflagration.<a id="FNanchor_II-23" href="#Footnote_II-23" class="fnanchor">[II-23]</a></p>

<p>Connected with the great flood of water, there is a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">66</a></span>
Mexican tradition presenting some analogies to the story
of Noah and his ark. In most of the painted manuscripts
supposed to relate to this event, a kind of boat is
represented floating over the waste of water, and containing
a man and a woman. Even the Tlascaltecs, the
Zapotecs, the Miztecs, and the people of Michoacan are
said to have had such pictures. The man is variously
called Coxcox, Teocipactli, Tezpi, and Nata; the woman
Xochiquetzal and Nena.<a id="FNanchor_II-24" href="#Footnote_II-24" class="fnanchor">[II-24]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE TOWER OF BABEL.</p>

<p>The following has been usually accepted as the ordinary
Mexican version of this myth: In Atonatiuh, the
Age of Water, a great flood covered all the face of the
earth, and the inhabitants thereof were turned into
fishes. Only one man and one woman escaped, saving
themselves in the hollow trunk of an <i>ahahuete</i> or bald
cypress; the name of the man being Coxcox, and that
of his wife Xochiquetzal. On the waters abating a little
they grounded their ark on the Peak of Colhuacan, the
Ararat of Mexico. Here they increased and multiplied,
and children began to gather about them, children who
were all born dumb. And a dove came and gave them
tongues, innumerable languages. Only fifteen of the
descendants of Coxcox, who afterward became heads of
families, spake the same language or could at all understand
each other; and from these fifteen are descended
the Toltecs, the Aztecs, and the Acolhúas. This dove
is not the only bird mentioned in these deluvial traditions,
and must by no means be confounded with the
birds of another palpably Christianized story. For in
Michoacan a tradition was preserved, following which
the name of the Mexican Noah was Tezpi. With better
fortune than that ascribed to Coxcox, he was able to
save, in a spacious vessel, not only himself and his wife,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">67</a></span>
but also his children, several animals, and a quantity of
grain for the common use. When the waters began to
subside, he sent out a vulture that it might go to and
fro on the earth and bring him word again when the dry
land began to appear. But the vulture fed upon the
carcasses that were strewed in every part, and never returned.
Then Tezpi sent out other birds, and among
these was a humming-bird. And when the sun began to
cover the earth with a new verdure, the humming-bird
returned to its old refuge bearing green leaves. And
Tezpi saw that his vessel was aground near the mountain
of Colhuacan and he landed there.</p>

<p>The Mexicans round Cholula had a special legend,
connecting the escape of a remnant from the great deluge
with the often-mentioned story of the origin of the
people of Anáhuac from Chicomoztoc, or the Seven
Caves. At the time of the cataclysm, the country, according
to Pedro de los Rios, was inhabited by giants.
Some of these perished utterly; others were changed into
fishes; while seven brothers of them found safety by
closing themselves into certain caves in a mountain
called Tlaloc. When the waters were assuaged, one
of the giants, Xelhua, surnamed the Architect, went to
Cholula and began to build an artificial mountain,
as a monument and a memorial of the Tlaloc that
had sheltered him and his when the angry waters swept
through all the land. The bricks were made in Tlamanalco,
at the foot of the Sierra de Cocotl, and passed to
Cholula from hand to hand along a file of men&mdash;whence
these came is not said&mdash;stretching between the two places.
Then were the jealousy and the anger of the gods
aroused, as the huge pyramid rose slowly up, threatening
to reach the clouds and the great heaven itself; and
the gods launched their fire upon the builders and slew
many, so that the work was stopped.<a id="FNanchor_II-25" href="#Footnote_II-25" class="fnanchor">[II-25]</a> But the half-finished
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">68</a></span>
structure, afterwards dedicated by the Cholultecs
to Quetzalcoatl, still remains to show how well Xelhua,
the giant, deserved his surname of the Architect.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">69</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE MEXICAN DELUGE.</p>

<p>Yet another record remains to us of a traditional
Mexican deluge, in the following extract from the Chimalpopoca
Manuscript. Its words seem to have a familiar
sound; but it would hardly be scientific to draw from
such a fragment any very sweeping conclusion as to its
relationship, whether that be Quiché or Christian:&mdash;</p>

<p>When the Sun, or Age, Nahui-Atl came, there had
passed already four hundred years; then came two hundred
years, then seventy and six, and then mankind
were lost and drowned and turned into fishes. The
waters and the sky drew near each other; in a single
day all was lost; the day Four Flower consumed all
that there was of our flesh. And this year was the year
Ce-Calli; on the first day, Nahui-Atl, all was lost. The
very mountains were swallowed up in the flood and the
waters remained, lying tranquil during fifty and two
spring-times. But before the flood began, Titlacahuan
had warned the man Nata and his wife Nena, saying:
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">70</a></span>
Make now no more pulque, but hollow out to yourselves
a great cypress, into which you shall enter when, in the
month Tozoztli, the waters shall near the sky. Then
they entered into it, and when Titlacahuan had shut
them in, he said to the man: Thou shalt eat but a single
ear of maize, and thy wife but one also. And when
they had finished eating, each an ear of maize, they prepared
to set forth, for the waters remained tranquil and
their log moved no longer; and opening it they began to
see the fishes. Then they lit a fire, rubbing pieces of
wood together, and they roasted fish. And behold the
deities Citlallinicué and Citlallatonac looking down from
above, cried out: O divine Lord! what is this fire that
they make there? wherefore do they so fill the heaven
with smoke? And immediately Titlacahuan Tetzcatlipoca
came down, and set himself to grumble, saying:
What does this fire here? Then he seized the fishes and
fashioned them behind and before, and changed them
into dogs.<a id="FNanchor_II-26" href="#Footnote_II-26" class="fnanchor">[II-26]</a></p>

<p>We turn now to the traditions of some nations situated
on the outskirts of the Mexican Empire, traditions differing
from those of Mexico, if not in their elements, at
least in the combination of those elements. Following
our usual custom, I give the following legend belonging
to the Miztecs just as they themselves were accustomed
to depict and to interpret it in their primitive
scrolls:&mdash;<a id="FNanchor_II-27" href="#Footnote_II-27" class="fnanchor">[II-27]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE FLYING HEROES OF MIZTECA.</p>

<p>In the year and in the day of obscurity and darkness,
yea even before the days or the years were, when the
world was in a great darkness and chaos, when the earth
was covered with water and there was nothing but mud
and slime on all the face of the earth&mdash;behold a god
became visible, and his name was the Deer, and his surname
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">71</a></span>
was the Lion-Snake. There appeared also a very
beautiful goddess called the Deer, and surnamed the
Tiger-Snake.<a id="FNanchor_II-28" href="#Footnote_II-28" class="fnanchor">[II-28]</a> These two gods were the origin and beginning
of all the gods.</p>

<p>Now when these two gods became visible in the world,
they made, in their knowledge and omnipotence, a great
rock, upon which they built a very sumptuous palace, a
masterpiece of skill, in which they made their abode
upon earth. On the highest part of this building there
was an axe of copper, the edge being uppermost, and on
this axe the heavens rested.</p>

<p>This rock and the palace of the gods were on a mountain
in the neighborhood of the town of Apoala in the province
of Mizteca Alta. The rock was called The Place
of Heaven; there the gods first abode on earth, living
many years in great rest and content, as in a happy and
delicious land, though the world still lay in obscurity
and darkness.</p>

<p>The father and mother of all the gods being here in
their place, two sons were born to them, very handsome
and very learned in all wisdom and arts. The first was
called the Wind of Nine Snakes, after the name of the
day on which he was born; and the second was called,
in like manner, the Wind of Nine Caves. Very daintily
indeed were these youths brought up. When the elder
wished to amuse himself, he took the form of an eagle, flying
thus far and wide; the younger turned himself into
a small beast of a serpent shape, having wings that he
used with such agility and sleight that he became invisible,
and flew through rocks and walls even as through
the air. As they went, the din and clamor of these
brethren was heard by those over whom they passed.
They took these figures to manifest the power that was in
them, both in transforming themselves and in resuming
again their original shape. And they abode in great peace
in the mansion of their parents, so they agreed to make
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">72</a></span>
a sacrifice and an offering to these gods, to their father
and to their mother. Then they took each a censer of
clay, and put fire therein, and poured in ground <i>beleño</i>
for incense; and this offering was the first that had ever
been made in the world. Next the brothers made to
themselves a garden, in which they put many trees,
and fruit-trees, and flowers, and roses, and odorous herbs
of different kinds. Joined to this garden they laid out
a very beautiful meadow, which they fitted up with all
things necessary for offering sacrifice to the gods. In
this manner the two brethren left their parents' house,
and fixed themselves in this garden to dress it and to
keep it, watering the trees and the plants and the odorous
herbs, multiplying them, and burning incense of
powder of beleño in censers of clay to the gods, their
father and mother. They made also vows to these gods,
and promises, praying that it might seem good to them
to shape the firmament and lighten the darkness of the
world, and to establish the foundation of the earth, or
rather to gather the waters together so that the earth
might appear&mdash;as they had no place to rest in save only
one little garden. And to make their prayers more obligatory
upon the gods, they pierced their ears and
tongues with flakes of flint, sprinkling the blood that
dropped from the wounds over the trees and plants of the
garden with a willow branch, as a sacred and blessed
thing. After this sort they employed themselves, postponing
pleasure till the time of the granting of their desire,
remaining always in subjection to the gods, their
father and mother, and attributing to them more power
and divinity than they really possessed.</p>

<p>Fray Garcia here makes a break in the relation&mdash;that
he may not weary his readers with so many absurdities&mdash;but
it would appear that the firmament was arranged
and the earth made fit for mankind, who about that time
must also have made their appearance. For there came
a great deluge afterwards, wherein perished many of the
sons and daughters that had been born to the gods; and
it is said that when the deluge was passed the human
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">73</a></span>
race was restored as at the first, and the Miztec kingdom
populated, and the heavens and the earth established.</p>

<p>This we may suppose to have been the traditional origin
of the common people; but the governing family of
Mizteca proclaimed themselves the descendants of two
youths born from two majestic trees that stood at the entrance
of the gorge of Apoala, and that maintained themselves
there despite a violent wind continually rising
from a cavern in the vicinity.</p>

<p class="sidenote">THE DUEL WITH THE SUN.</p>

<p>Whether the trees of themselves produced these youths,
or whether some primeval Æsir, as in the Scandinavian
story, gave them shape and blood and breath and sense,
we know not. We are only told that soon or late the
youths separated, each going his own way to conquer
lands for himself. The braver of the two coming to the
vicinity of Tilantongo, armed with buckler and bow, was
much vexed and oppressed by the ardent rays of the
sun, which he took to be the lord of that district striving
to prevent his entrance therein. Then the young
warrior strung his bow, and advanced his buckler before
him, and drew shafts from his quiver. He shot there
against the great light even till the going down of the
same; then he took possession of all that land, seeing he
had grievously wounded the sun, and forced him to hide
behind the mountains. Upon this story is founded the
lordship of all the caciques of Mizteca, and upon their
descent from this mighty archer their ancestor. Even
to this day, the chiefs of the Miztecs blazon as their
arms a plumed chief with bow, arrows, and shield, and
the sun in front of him setting behind gray clouds.<a id="FNanchor_II-29" href="#Footnote_II-29" class="fnanchor">[II-29]</a></p>

<p>Of the origin of the Zapotecs, a people bordering on
these Miztecs, Burgoa says, with a touching simplicity,
that he could find no account worthy of belief. Their
historical paintings he ascribes to the invention of the
devil, affirming hotly that these people were blinder in
such vanities than the Egyptians and the Chaldeans.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">74</a></span>
Some, he said, to boast of their valor made themselves
out the sons of lions and divers wild beasts; others,
grand lords of ancient lineage, were produced by the
greatest and most shady trees; while still others of an
unyielding and obstinate nature, were descended from
rocks. Their language, continues the worthy Provincial,
striking suddenly and by an undirected shot the very
center of mythological interpretation&mdash;their language
was full of metaphors; those who wished to persuade
spake always in parables, and in like manner painted
their historians.<a id="FNanchor_II-30" href="#Footnote_II-30" class="fnanchor">[II-30]</a></p>

<p>In Guatemala, according to the relations given to Father
Gerónimo Roman by the natives, it was believed
there was a time when nothing existed but a certain
divine Father called Xchmel, and a divine Mother called
Xtmana. To these were born three sons,<a id="FNanchor_II-31" href="#Footnote_II-31" class="fnanchor">[II-31]</a> the eldest of
whom, filled with pride and presumption, set about a
creation contrary to the will of his parents. But he
could create nothing save old vessels fit for mean uses,
such as earthen pots, jugs, and things still more despicable;
and he was hurled into hades. Then the two younger
brethren, called respectively Hunchevan and Hunavan,
prayed their parents for permission to attempt the
work in which their brother had failed so signally. And
they were granted leave, being told at the same time,
that inasmuch as they had humbled themselves, they
would succeed in their undertaking. Then they made
the heavens, and the earth with the plants thereon, and
fire and air, and out of the earth itself they made a man
and a woman&mdash;presumably the parents of the human
race.</p>

<p>According to Torquemada, there was a deluge some
time after this, and after the deluge the people continued
to invoke as god the great Father and the great Mother
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">75</a></span>
already mentioned. But at last a principal woman<a id="FNanchor_II-32" href="#Footnote_II-32" class="fnanchor">[II-32]</a>
among them, having received a revelation from heaven,
taught them the true name of God, and how that name
should be adored; all this, however, they afterward forgot.<a id="FNanchor_II-33" href="#Footnote_II-33" class="fnanchor">[II-33]</a></p>

<p>In Nicaragua, a country where the principal language
was a Mexican dialect, it was believed that ages ago
the world was destroyed by a flood in which the most
part of mankind perished. Afterward the <i>teotes</i>, or
gods, restocked the earth as at the beginning. Whence
came the teotes, no one knows; but the names of two
of them who took a principal part in the creation were
Tamagostat and Cipattonal.<a id="FNanchor_II-34" href="#Footnote_II-34" class="fnanchor">[II-34]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE COYOTE OF THE PAPAGOS.</p>

<p>Leaving now the Central American region we pass
north into the Papago country, lying south of the Gila,
with the river Santa Cruz on the east and the Gulf of
California on the west. Here we meet for the first time
the coyote, or prairie wolf; we find him much more than
an animal, something more even than a man, only a
little lower than the gods. In the following Papago
myth<a id="FNanchor_II-35" href="#Footnote_II-35" class="fnanchor">[II-35]</a> he figures as a prophet, and as a minister and assistant
to a certain great hero-god Montezuma, whom we
are destined to meet often, and in many characters, as a
central figure in the myths of the Gila valley:&mdash;</p>

<p class="sidenote">LEGEND OF MONTEZUMA.</p>

<p>The Great Spirit made the earth and all living things,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">76</a></span>
before he made man. And he descended from heaven, and
digging in the earth, found clay such as the potters use,
which, having again ascended into the sky, he dropped
into the hole that he had dug. Immediately there came
out Montezuma and, with the assistance of Montezuma,
the rest of the Indian tribes in order. Last of all came
the Apaches, wild from their natal hour, running away
as fast as they were created. Those first days of the
world were happy and peaceful days. The sun was
nearer the earth than he is now; his grateful rays made
all the seasons equal, and rendered garments unnecessary.
Men and beasts talked together, a common language
made all brethren. But an awful destruction
ended this happy age. A great flood destroyed all flesh
wherein was the breath of life; Montezuma and his
friend the Coyote alone escaping. For before the flood
began, the Coyote prophesied its coming, and Montezuma
took the warning and hollowed out a boat to himself,
keeping it ready on the topmost summit of Santa Rosa.
The Coyote also prepared an ark; gnawing down a great
cane by the river bank, entering it, and stopping up the
end with a certain gum. So when the waters rose these
two saved themselves, and met again at last on dry land
after the flood had passed away. Naturally enough Montezuma
was now anxious to know how much dry land
had been left, and he sent the Coyote off on four successive
journeys, to find exactly where the sea lay toward
each of the four winds. From the west and from the
south, the answer swiftly came: The sea is at hand. A
longer search was that made towards the east, but at last
there too was the sea found. On the north only was no
water found, though the faithful messenger almost
wearied himself out with searching. In the meantime
the Great Spirit, aided by Montezuma, had again repeopled
the world, and animals and men began to increase
and multiply. To Montezuma had been allotted
the care and government of the new race; but puffed up
with pride and self importance, he neglected the most important
duties of his onerous position, and suffered the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">77</a></span>
most disgraceful wickedness to pass unnoticed among the
people. In vain the Great Spirit came down to earth
and remonstrated with his vicegerent, who only scorned
his laws and advice, and ended at last by breaking out
into open rebellion. Then indeed the Great Spirit was
filled with anger, and he returned to heaven, pushing
back the sun on his way, to that remote part of the sky
he now occupies. But Montezuma hardened his heart,
and collecting all the tribes to aid him, set about building
a house that should reach up to heaven itself. Already
it had attained a great height, and contained many
apartments lined with gold, silver, and precious stones,
the whole threatening soon to make good the boast of its
architect, when the Great Spirit launched his thunder,
and laid its glory in ruins. Still Montezuma hardened
himself; proud and inflexible, he answered the thunderer
out of the haughty defiance of his heart; he ordered the
temple-houses to be desecrated, and the holy images to
be dragged in the dust, he made them a scoff and byword
for the very children in the village streets. Then
the Great Spirit prepared his supreme punishment. He
sent an insect flying away towards the east, towards an
unknown land, to bring the Spaniards. When these
came, they made war upon Montezuma and destroyed
him, and utterly dissipated the idea of his divinity.<a id="FNanchor_II-36" href="#Footnote_II-36" class="fnanchor">[II-36]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">DELUGE OF THE PIMAS.</p>

<p>The Pimas,<a id="FNanchor_II-37" href="#Footnote_II-37" class="fnanchor">[II-37]</a> a neighboring and closely allied people
to the Papagos, say that the earth was made by a certain
Chiowotmahke, that is to say Earth-prophet. It
appeared in the beginning like a spider's web, stretching
far and fragile across the nothingness that was. Then
the Earth-prophet flew over all lands in the form of a
butterfly, till he came to the place he judged fit for his
purpose, and there he made man. And the thing was
after this wise: The Creator took clay in his hands, and
mixing it with the sweat of his own body, kneaded the
whole into a lump. Then he blew upon the lump till it
was filled with life and began to move; and it became
man and woman. This Creator had a son called Szeukha,
who, when the world was beginning to be tolerably
peopled, lived in the Gila valley, where lived also at the
same time a great prophet, whose name has been forgotten.
Upon a certain night when the prophet slept, he
was wakened by a noise at the door of his house, and
when he looked, a great Eagle stood before him. And
the Eagle spake: Arise, thou that healest the sick, thou
that shouldest know what is to come, for behold a deluge
is at hand. But the prophet laughed the bird to scorn
and gathered his robes about him and slept. Afterwards
the Eagle came again and warned him of the
waters near at hand; but he gave no ear to the bird at
all. Perhaps he would not listen because this Eagle had
an exceedingly bad reputation among men, being reported
to take at times the form of an old woman that
lured away girls and children to a certain cliff so that
they were never seen again; of this, however, more anon.
A third time, the Eagle came to warn the prophet, and
to say that all the valley of the Gila should be laid waste
with water; but the prophet gave no heed. Then, in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">79</a></span>
the twinkling of an eye, and even as the flapping of the
Eagle's wings died away into the night, there came a
peal of thunder and an awful crash; and a green mound
of water reared itself over the plain. It seemed to stand
upright for a second, then, cut incessantly by the lightning,
goaded on like a great beast, it flung itself upon the
prophet's hut. When the morning broke there was nothing
to be seen alive but one man&mdash;if indeed he were a
man; Szeukha, the son of the Creator, had saved himself
by floating on a ball of gum or resin. On the waters falling
a little, he landed near the mouth of the Salt River,
upon a mountain where there is a cave that can still be
seen, together with the tools and utensils Szeukha used
while he lived there. Szeukha was very angry with
the Great Eagle, who he probably thought had had more
to do with bringing on the flood than appears in the
narrative. At any rate the general reputation of the
bird was sufficiently bad, and Szeukha prepared a kind
of rope ladder from a very tough species of tree, much
like woodbine, with the aid of which he climbed up to
the cliff where the Eagle lived, and slew him.<a id="FNanchor_II-38" href="#Footnote_II-38" class="fnanchor">[II-38]</a> Looking
about here, he found the mutilated and decaying bodies of
a great multitude of those that the Eagle had stolen and
taken for a prey; and he raised them all to life again and
sent them away to repeople the earth. In the house or
den of the Eagle, he found a woman that the monster had
taken to wife, and a child. These he sent also upon
their way, and from these are descended that great people
called Hohocam, 'ancients or grandfathers,' who
were led in all their wanderings by an eagle, and who
eventually passed into Mexico.<a id="FNanchor_II-39" href="#Footnote_II-39" class="fnanchor">[II-39]</a> One of these Hohocam
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">80</a></span>
named Sivano, built the Casa Grande on the Gila, and indeed
the ruins of this structure are called after his name
to this day. On the death of Sivano, his son led a
branch of the Hohocam to Salt River, where he built
certain edifices and dug a large canal, or <i>acequia</i>. At
last it came about that a woman ruled over the Hohocam.
Her throne was cut out of a blue stone, and a mysterious
bird was her constant attendant. These Hohocam
were at war with a people that lived to the east of them,
on the Rio Verde, and one day the bird warned her that
the enemy was at hand. The warning was disregarded
or it came too late, for the eastern people came down in
three bands; destroyed the cities of the Hohocam, and
killed or drove away all the inhabitants.</p>

<p class="p2">Most of the Pueblo tribes call themselves the descendants
of Montezuma;<a id="FNanchor_II-40" href="#Footnote_II-40" class="fnanchor">[II-40]</a> the Moquis, however, have a quite
different story of their origin. They believe in a great
Father living where the sun rises; and in a great Mother,
whose home is where the sun goes down. The Father
is the father of evil, war, pestilence, and famine;
but from the Mother are all joys, peace, plenty, and
health. In the beginning of time the Mother produced
from her western home nine races of men in the following
primary forms: First, the Deer race; second, the
Sand race; third, the Water race; fourth, the Bear race;
fifth, the Hare race; sixth, the Prairie-wolf race; seventh,
the Rattle-snake race; eighth, the Tobacco-plant race;
and ninth, the Reed-grass race. All these the Mother
placed respectively on the spots where their villages now
stand, and transformed them into the men who built the
present Pueblos. These race-distinctions are still sharply
kept up; for they are believed to be realities, not
only of the past and present, but also of the future; every
man when he dies shall be resolved into his primeval
form; shall wave in the grass, or drift in the sand, or
prowl on the prairie as in the beginning.<a id="FNanchor_II-41" href="#Footnote_II-41" class="fnanchor">[II-41]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">81</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">CAVE-ORIGIN OF THE NAVAJOS.</p>

<p>The Navajos, living north of the Pueblos, say that at
one time all the nations, Navajos, Pueblos, Coyoteros,
and white people, lived together, underground in the heart
of a mountain near the river San Juan. Their only
food was meat, which they had in abundance, for all
kinds of game were closed up with them in their cave;
but their light was dim and only endured for a few
hours each day. There were happily two dumb men
among the Navajos, flute-players who enlivened the darkness
with music. One of these striking by chance on
the roof of the limbo with his flute, brought out a hollow
sound, upon which the elders of the tribes determined
to bore in the direction whence the sound came.
The flute was then set up against the roof, and the Raccoon
sent up the tube to dig a way out; but he could
not. Then the Moth-worm mounted into the breach,
and bored and bored till he found himself suddenly on
the outside of the mountain and surrounded by water.
Under these novel circumstances, he heaped up a little
mound and set himself down on it to observe and ponder
the situation. A critical situation enough! for, from
the four corners of the universe, four great white Swans
bore down upon him, every one with two arrows, one
under either wing. The Swan from the north reached
him first, and having pierced him with two arrows, drew
them out and examined their points, exclaiming as the
result: He is of my race. So also, in succession, did all
the others. Then they went away; and towards the directions
in which they departed, to the north, south, east,
and west, were found four great <i>arroyos</i>, by which all
the water flowed off, leaving only mud. The worm now
returned to the cave, and the Raccoon went up into the
mud, sinking in it mid-leg deep, as the marks on his fur
show to this day. And the wind began to rise, sweeping
up the four great arroyos, and the mud was dried
away. Then the men and the animals began to come
up from their cave, and their coming up required several
days. First came the Navajos, and no sooner had
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">82</a></span>
they reached the surface then they commenced gaming
at <i>patole</i>, their favorite game. Then came the Pueblos
and other Indians who crop their hair and build houses.
Lastly came the white people, who started off at once for
the rising sun and were lost sight of for many winters.</p>

<p>While these nations lived underground they all spake
one tongue; but with the light of day and the level of
earth, came many languages. The earth was at this
time very small and the light was quite as scanty as it
had been down below; for there was as yet no heaven,
nor sun, nor moon, nor stars. So another council of the
ancients was held and a committee of their number appointed
to manufacture these luminaries. A large house
or workshop was erected; and when the sun and moon
were ready, they were entrusted to the direction and
guidance of the two dumb fluters already mentioned.
The one who got charge of the sun came very near,
through his clumsiness in his new office, to making a
Phaethon of himself and setting fire to the earth. The
old men, however, either more lenient than Zeus or lacking
his thunder, contented themselves with forcing the
offender back by puffing the smoke of their pipes into
his face. Since then the increasing size of the earth
has four times rendered it necessary that he should be
put back, and his course farther removed from the world
and from the subterranean cave to which he nightly retires
with the great light. At night also the other dumb
man issues from this cave, bearing the moon under his
arm, and lighting up such part of the world as he can.
Next the old men set to work to make the heavens, intending
to broider in the stars in beautiful patterns, of
bears, birds, and such things. But just as they had
made a beginning a prairie-wolf rushed in, and crying
out: Why all this trouble and embroidery? scattered the
pile of stars over all the floor of heaven, just as they
still lie.</p>

<p>When now the world and its firmament had been finished,
the old men prepared two earthen <i>tinages</i> or water-jars,
and having decorated one with bright colors, filled
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">83</a></span>
it with trifles; while the other was left plain on the outside,
but filled within with flocks and herds and riches
of all kinds. These jars being covered and presented to
the Navajos and Pueblos, the former chose the gaudy
but paltry jar; while the Pueblos received the plain and
rich vessel; each nation showing in its choice traits
which characterize it to this day. Next there arose
among the Navajos a great gambler, who went on winning
the goods and the persons of his opponents till he
had won the whole tribe. Upon this, one of the old
men became indignant, set the gambler on his bowstring
and shot him off into space&mdash;an unfortunate proceeding,
for the fellow returned in a short time with firearms
and the Spaniards. Let me conclude by telling
how the Navajos came by the seed they now cultivate:
All the wise men being one day assembled, a turkey-hen
came flying from the direction of the morning star, and
shook from her feathers an ear of blue corn into the
midst of the company; and in subsequent visits brought
all the other seeds they possess.<a id="FNanchor_II-42" href="#Footnote_II-42" class="fnanchor">[II-42]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">ORIGIN-MYTHS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.</p>

<p class="p2">Of some tribes, we do not know that they possess any
other ideas of their origin than the name of their first
ancestor, or the name of a creator or a tradition of his
existence.</p>

<p>The Sinaloas, from Culiacan north to the Yaqui River,
have dances in honor of a certain Viriseva, the mother
of the first man. This first man, who was her son, and
called Vairubi, they hold in like esteem.<a id="FNanchor_II-43" href="#Footnote_II-43" class="fnanchor">[II-43]</a> The Cochimis,
of Lower California, amid an apparent multiplicity of
gods, say there is in reality only one, who created
heaven, earth, plants, animals, and man.<a id="FNanchor_II-44" href="#Footnote_II-44" class="fnanchor">[II-44]</a> The Pericues,
also of Lower California, call the creator Niparaya, and
say that the heavens are his dwelling-place. A sect of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">84</a></span>
the same tribe add that the stars are made of metal, and
are the work of a certain Purutabui; while the moon has
been made by one Cucunumic.<a id="FNanchor_II-45" href="#Footnote_II-45" class="fnanchor">[II-45]</a></p>

<p>The nations of Los Angeles County, California, believe
that their one god, Quaoar, came down from heaven;
and, after reducing chaos to order, put the world on the
back of seven giants. He then created the lower animals,
and lastly a man and a woman. These were made
separately out of earth and called, the man Tobohar, and
the woman Pabavit.<a id="FNanchor_II-46" href="#Footnote_II-46" class="fnanchor">[II-46]</a></p>

<p>Hugo Reid, to whom we are mainly indebted for the
mythology of Southern California, and who is an excellent
authority, inasmuch as his wife was an Indian woman
of that country, besides the preceding gives us another
and different tradition on the same subject: Two great
Beings made the world, filled it with grass and trees, and
gave form, life, and motion to the various animals that
people land and sea. When this work was done, the
elder Creator went up to heaven and left his brother
alone on the earth. The solitary god left below, made to
himself men-children, that he should not be utterly companionless.
Fortunately also, about this time, the moon
came to that neighborhood; she was very fair in her
delicate beauty, very kind-hearted, and she filled the
place of a mother to the men-children that the god had
created. She watched over them, and guarded them
from all evil things of the night, standing at the door of
their lodge. The children grew up very happily, laying
great store by the love with which their guardians
regarded them; but there came a day when their heart
saddened, in which they began to notice that neither
their god-creator nor their moon foster-mother gave them
any longer undivided affection and care, but that instead,
the two great ones seemed to waste much precious
love upon each other. The tall god began to steal out
of their lodge at dusk, and spend the night watches in
the company of the white-haired moon, who, on the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">85</a></span>
other hand, did not seem on these occasions to pay such
absorbing attention to her sentinel duty as at other times.
The children grew sad at this, and bitter at the heart
with a boyish jealousy. But worse was yet to come:
one night they were awakened by a querulous wailing
in their lodge, and the earliest dawn showed them
a strange thing, which they afterwards came to know
was a new-born infant, lying in the doorway. The god
and the moon had eloped together; their Great One
had returned to his place beyond the ether, and that he
might not be separated from his paramour, he had appointed
her at the same time a lodge in the great firmament;
where she may yet be seen, with her gauzy robe and
shining silver hair, treading celestial paths. The child
left on the earth was a girl. She grew up very soft,
very bright, very beautiful, like her mother; but like
her mother also, O so fickle and frail! She was the
first of woman-kind, from her are all other women
descended, and from the moon; and as the moon changes
so they all change, say the philosophers of Los Angeles.<a id="FNanchor_II-47" href="#Footnote_II-47" class="fnanchor">[II-47]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">CENTRAL-CALIFORNIAN CREATION-MYTHS.</p>

<p>A much more prosaic and materialistic origin is that
accorded to the moon in the traditions of the Gallinomeros
of Central California.<a id="FNanchor_II-48" href="#Footnote_II-48" class="fnanchor">[II-48]</a> In the beginning, they
say, there was no light, but a thick darkness covered all
the earth. Man stumbled blindly against man and
against the animals, the birds clashed together in the
air, and confusion reigned everywhere. The Hawk
happening by chance to fly into the face of the Coyote,
there followed mutual apologies and afterwards a long
discussion on the emergency of the situation. Determined
to make some effort toward abating the public
evil, the two set about a remedy. The Coyote gathered
a great heap of tules, rolled them into a ball, and gave it
to the Hawk, together with some pieces of flint. Gathering
all together as well as he could, the Hawk flew
straight up into the sky, where he struck fire with the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">86</a></span>
flints, lit his ball of reeds, and left it there, whirling
along all in a fierce red glow as it continues to the present;
for it is the sun. In the same way the moon was
made, but as the tules of which it was constructed were
rather damp, its light has been always somewhat uncertain
and feeble.<a id="FNanchor_II-49" href="#Footnote_II-49" class="fnanchor">[II-49]</a></p>

<p>In northern California, we find the Mattoles,<a id="FNanchor_II-50" href="#Footnote_II-50" class="fnanchor">[II-50]</a> who
connect a tradition of a destructive flood with Taylor
Peak, a mountain in their locality, on which they
say their forefathers took refuge. As to the creation,
they teach that a certain Big Man began by making
the naked earth, silent and bleak, with nothing of
plant or animal thereon, save one Indian, who roamed
about in a wofully hungry and desolate state. Suddenly
there rose a terrible whirlwind, the air grew dark
and thick with dust and drifting sand, and the Indian
fell upon his face in sore dread. Then there came a
great calm, and the man rose and looked, and lo, all the
earth was perfect and peopled; the grass and the trees
were green on every plain and hill; the beasts of the
fields, the fowls of the air, the creeping things, the things
that swim, moved everywhere in his sight. There is a
limit set to the number of the animals, which is this:
only a certain number of animal spirits are in existence;
when one beast dies, his spirit immediately takes up its
abode in another body, so that the whole number of animals
is always the same, and the original spirits move in
an endless circle of earthy immortality.<a id="FNanchor_II-51" href="#Footnote_II-51" class="fnanchor">[II-51]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE COYOTE OF THE CALIFORNIANS.</p>

<p>We pass now to a train of myths in which the Coyote
again appears, figuring in many important and somewhat
mystical rôles&mdash;figuring in fact as the great Somebody
of many tribes. To him, though involuntarily as
it appears, are owing the fish to be found in Clear Lake.
The story runs that one summer long ago there was a
terrible drought in that region, followed by a plague of
grasshoppers. The Coyote ate a great quantity of these
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">87</a></span>
grasshoppers, and drank up the whole lake to quench his
thirst. After this he lay down to sleep off the effects of
his extraordinary repast, and while he slept a man came
up from the south country and thrust him through with
a spear. Then all the water he had drunk flowed back
through his wound into the lake, and with the water the
grasshoppers he had eaten; and these insects became
fishes, the same that still swim in Clear Lake.<a id="FNanchor_II-52" href="#Footnote_II-52" class="fnanchor">[II-52]</a></p>

<p>The Californians in most cases describe themselves as
originating from the Coyote, and more remotely, from
the very soil they tread. In the language of Mr.
Powers&mdash;whose extended personal investigations give
him the right to speak with authority&mdash;"All the aboriginal
inhabitants of California, without exception,
believe that their first ancestors were created directly
from the earth of their respective present dwelling-places,
and, in very many cases, that these ancestors were
coyotes."<a id="FNanchor_II-53" href="#Footnote_II-53" class="fnanchor">[II-53]</a></p>

<p>The Potoyantes give an ingenious account of the
transformation of the first coyotes into men: There was
an age in which no men existed, nothing but coyotes.
When one of these animals died, his body used to breed
a multitude of little animals, much as the carcass of the
huge Ymir, rotting in Ginnunga-gap, bred the maggots
that turned to dwarfs. The little animals of our story
were in reality spirits, which, after crawling about for a
time on the dead coyote, and taking all kinds of shapes,
ended by spreading wings and floating off to the moon.
This evidently would not do; the earth was in danger
of becoming depopulated; so the old coyotes took counsel
together if perchance they might devise a remedy.
The result was a general order that, for the time to come,
all bodies should be incinerated immediately after death.
Thus originated the custom of burning the dead, a
custom still kept up among these people. We next learn&mdash;what
indeed might have been expected of animals of
such wisdom and parts&mdash;that these primeval coyotes
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">88</a></span>
began by degrees to assume the shape of men. At first,
it is true, with many imperfections; but, a toe, an ear,
a hand, bit by bit, they were gradually builded up into
the perfect form of man looking upward. For one
thing they still grieve, however, of all their lost estate&mdash;their
tails are gone. An acquired habit of sitting upright,
has utterly erased and destroyed that beautiful
member. Lost is indeed lost, and gone is gone for ever,
yet still when in dance and festival, the Potoyante
throws off the weary burden of hard and utilitarian care,
he attaches to himself, as nearly as may be in the ancient
place, an artificial tail, and forgets for a happy hour the
degeneracy of the present in simulating the glory of the
past.<a id="FNanchor_II-54" href="#Footnote_II-54" class="fnanchor">[II-54]</a></p>

<p>The Californians tell again of a great flood, or at least
of a time when the whole country, with the exception of
Mount Diablo and Reed Peak, was covered with water.
There was a Coyote on the peak, the only living thing
the wide world over, and there was a single feather tossing
about on the rippled water. The Coyote was looking
at the feather, and even as he looked, flesh and
bones and other feathers, came and joined themselves
to the first, and became an Eagle. There was a stir on
the water, a rush of broad pinions, and before the
widening circles reached the island-hill, the bird stood
beside the astonished Coyote. The two came soon to be
acquainted and to be good friends, and they made occasional
excursions together to the other hill, the Eagle
flying leisurely overhead while the Coyote swam. After
a time they began to feel lonely, so they created men; and
as the men multiplied the waters abated, till the dry land
came to be much as it is at present.</p>

<p class="sidenote">HOW THE GOLDEN GATE WAS OPENED.</p>

<p>Now, also, the Sacramento River and the San Joaquin
began to find their way into the Pacific, through the
mountains which, up to this time, had stretched across
the mouth of San Francisco Bay. No Poseidon clove
the hills with his trident, as when the pleasant vale of
Tempe was formed, but a strong earthquake tore the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">89</a></span>
rock apart and opened the Golden Gate between the
waters within and those without. Before this there had
existed only two outlets for the drainage of the whole
country; one was the Russian River, and the other the
San Juan.<a id="FNanchor_II-55" href="#Footnote_II-55" class="fnanchor">[II-55]</a></p>

<p>The natives in the vicinity of Lake Tahoe, ascribe
its origin to a great natural convulsion. There was
a time, they say, when their tribe possessed the whole
earth, and were strong, numerous, and rich; but a day
came in which a people rose up stronger than they,
and defeated and enslaved them. Afterwards the
Great Spirit sent an immense wave across the continent
from the sea, and this wave engulfed both
the oppressors and the oppressed, all but a very small
remnant. Then the taskmasters made the remaining
people raise up a great temple, so that they, of the
ruling caste, should have a refuge in case of another flood,
and on the top of this temple the masters worshiped a
column of perpetual fire.</p>

<p>Half a moon had not elapsed, however, before the
earth was again troubled, this time with strong convulsions
and thunderings, upon which the masters took
refuge in their great tower, closing the people out.
The poor slaves fled to the Humboldt River, and
getting into canoes paddled for life from the awful sight
behind them. For the land was tossing like a troubled
sea, and casting up fire, smoke, and ashes. The flames
went up to the very heaven and melted many stars, so
that they rained down in molten metal upon the earth,
forming the ore that the white men seek. The Sierra
was mounded up from the bosom of the earth; while
the place where the great fort stood sank, leaving only
the dome on the top exposed above the waters of Lake
Tahoe. The inmates of the temple-tower clung to this
dome to save themselves from drowning; but the Great
Spirit walked upon the waters in his wrath, and took
the oppressors one by one like pebbles, and threw them
far into the recesses of a great cavern, on the east side of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">90</a></span>
the lake, called to this day the Spirit Lodge, where the
waters shut them in. There must they remain till a
last great volcanic burning, which is to overturn the
whole earth, shall again set them free. In the depths of
their cavern-prison they may still be heard, wailing and
moaning, when the snows melt and the waters swell in
the lake.<a id="FNanchor_II-56" href="#Footnote_II-56" class="fnanchor">[II-56]</a></p>

<p>We again meet the Coyote among the Cahrocs of
Klamath River in Northern California. These Cahrocs
believe in a certain Chareya, Old Man Above, who made
the world, sitting the while upon a certain stool now in
the possession of the high-priest, or chief medicine-man.
After the creation of the earth, Chareya first made fishes,
then the lower animals, and lastly man, upon whom was
conferred the power of assigning to each animal its respective
duties and position. The man determined to
give each a bow, the length of which should denote the
rank of the receiver. So he called all the animals
together, and told them that next day, early in the
morning, the distribution of bows would take place.
Now the Coyote greatly desired the longest bow; and,
in order to be in first at the division, he determined to
remain awake all night. His anxiety sustained him for
some time; but just before morning he gave way, and
fell into a sound sleep. The consequence was, he was
last at the rendezvous, and got the shortest bow of all.
The man took pity on his distress, however, and brought
the matter to the notice of Chareya, who, on considering
the circumstances, decreed that the Coyote should become
the most cunning of animals, as he remains to this time.
The Coyote was very grateful to the man for his intercession,
and he became his friend and the friend of his
children, and did many things to aid mankind as we
shall see hereafter.<a id="FNanchor_II-57" href="#Footnote_II-57" class="fnanchor">[II-57]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">MOUNT SHASTA THE WIGWAM OF THE GREAT SPIRIT.</p>

<p>The natives in the neighborhood of Mount Shasta, in
Northern California, say that the Great Spirit made this
mountain first of all. Boring a hole in the sky, using a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">91</a></span>
large stone as an auger, he pushed down snow and ice
until they had reached the desired height; then he
stepped from cloud to cloud down to the great icy pile,
and from it to the earth, where he planted the first trees
by merely putting his finger into the soil here and there.
The sun began to melt the snow; the snow produced
water; the water ran down the sides of the mountains,
refreshed the trees, and made rivers. The Creator
gathered the leaves that fell from the trees, blew upon
them, and they became birds. He took a stick and
broke it into pieces; of the small end he made fishes;
and of the middle of the stick he made animals&mdash;the
grizzly bear excepted, which he formed from the big end
of his stick, appointing him to be master over all the
others. Indeed this animal was then so large, strong,
and cunning, that the Creator somewhat feared him, and
hollowed out Mount Shasta as a wigwam for himself,
where he might reside while on earth, in the most perfect
security and comfort. So the smoke was soon to be
seen curling up from the mountain, where the Great
Spirit and his family lived, and still live, though their
hearth-fire is alight no longer, now that the white man
is in the land. This was thousands of snows ago, and
there came after this a late and severe spring-time, in
which a memorable storm blew up from the sea, shaking
the huge lodge to its base. The Great Spirit commanded
his daughter, little more than an infant, to go up and
bid the wind to be still, cautioning her at the same time
in his fatherly way, not to put her head out into the
blast, but only to thrust out her little red arm and make
a sign before she delivered her message. The eager
child hastened up to the hole in the roof, did as she
was told, and then turned to descend; but the Eve was
too strong in her to leave without a look at the forbidden
world outside and the rivers and the trees, at the far
ocean and the great waves that the storm had made as
hoary as the forests when the snow is on the firs. She
stopped, she put out her head to look; instantly the
storm took her by the long hair, and blew her down to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">92</a></span>
the earth, down the mountain side, over the smooth ice
and soft snow, down to the land of the grizzly bears.</p>

<p>Now the grizzly bears were somewhat different then
from what they are at present. In appearance they
were much the same it is true; but they walked then on
their hind legs like men, and talked, and carried clubs,
using the fore-limbs as men use their arms.</p>

<p class="sidenote">THE GRIZZLY FAMILY OF MOUNT SHASTA.</p>

<p>There was a family of these grizzlies living at the
foot of the mountain, at the place where the child was
blown to. The father was returning from the hunt
with his club on his shoulder and a young elk in his
hand, when he saw the little shivering waif lying on the
snow with her hair all tangled about her. The old
Grizzly, pitying and wondering at the strange forlorn
creature, lifted it up, and carried it in to his wife to see
what should be done. She too was pitiful, and she fed
it from her own breast, bringing it up quietly as one of
her family. So the girl grew up, and the eldest son
of the old Grizzly married her, and their offspring was
neither grizzly nor Great Spirit, but man. Very proud
indeed were the whole grizzly nation of the new race,
and uniting their strength from all parts of the country,
they built the young mother and her family a mountain
wigwam near that of the Great Spirit; and this
structure of theirs is now known as Little Mount Shasta.
Many years passed away, and at last the old grandmother
Grizzly became very feeble and felt that she must soon
die. She knew that the girl she had adopted was the
daughter of the Great Spirit, and her conscience troubled
her that she had never let him know anything of
the fate of his child. So she called all the grizzlies
together to the new lodge, and sent her eldest grandson
up on a cloud to the summit of Mount Shasta, to tell
the father that his daughter yet lived. When the
Great Spirit heard that, he was so glad that he immediately
ran down the mountain, on the south side, toward
where he had been told his daughter was; and such
was the swiftness of his pace that the snow was melted
here and there along his course, as it remains to this
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">93</a></span>
day. The grizzlies had prepared him an honorable
reception, and as he approached his daughter's home, he
found them standing in thousands in two files, on either
side of the door, with their clubs under their arms. He
had never pictured his daughter as aught but the little
child he had loved so long ago; but when he found that
she was a mother, and that he had been betrayed into the
creation of a new race, his anger overcame him; he scowled
so terribly on the poor old grandmother Grizzly that she
died upon the spot. At this all the bears set up a fearful
howl, but the exasperated father, taking his lost darling
on his shoulder, turned to the armed host, and in his
fury cursed them. Peace! he said. Be silent for ever!
Let no articulate word ever again pass your lips,
neither stand any more upright; but use your hands as
feet, and look downward until I come again! Then he
drove them all out; he drove out also the new race of men,
shut to the door of Little Mount Shasta, and passed
away to his mountain, carrying his daughter; and her
or him no eye has since seen. The grizzlies never spoke
again, nor stood up; save indeed when fighting for their
life, when the Great Spirit still permits them to stand as
in the old time, and to use their fists like men. No Indian
tracing his descent from the spirit mother and the grizzly,
as here described, will kill a grizzly bear; and if by an
evil chance a grizzly kill a man in any place, that spot
becomes memorable, and every one that passes casts a
stone there till a great pile is thrown up.<a id="FNanchor_II-58" href="#Footnote_II-58" class="fnanchor">[II-58]</a></p>

<p>Let us now pass on, and going east and north, enter
the Shoshone country. In Idaho there are certain famous
Soda Springs whose origin the Snakes refer to the close
of their happiest age. Long ago, the legend runs, when
the cotton-woods on the Big River were no larger than
arrows, all red men were at peace, the hatchet was
everywhere buried, and hunter met hunter in the game-lands
of the one or the other, with all hospitality and good-will.
During this state of things, two chiefs, one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span>
Shoshone, the other of the Comanche nation, met one
day at a certain spring. The Shoshone had been successful
in the chase, and the Comanche very unlucky,
which put the latter in rather an ill humor. So he got
up a dispute with the other as to the importance of their
respective and related tribes, and ended by making an
unprovoked and treacherous attack on the Shoshone,
striking him into the water from behind, when he had
stooped to drink. The murdered man fell forward into
the water, and immediately a strange commotion was
observable there; great bubbles and spirts of gas shot
up from the bottom of the pool, and amid a cloud of
vapor there arose also an old white-haired Indian, armed
with a ponderous club of elk-horn. Well the assassin
knew who stood before him; the totem on the breast
was that of Wankanaga, the father both of the Shoshone
and of the Comanche nations, an ancient famous for his
brave deeds, and celebrated in the hieroglyphic pictures
of both peoples. Accursed of two nations! cried the old
man, this day hast thou put death between the two
greatest peoples under the sun; see, the blood of this
Shoshone cries out to the Great Spirit for vengeance. And
he dashed out the brains of the Comanche with his club,
and the murderer fell there beside his victim into the
spring. After that the spring became foul and bitter,
nor even to this day can any one drink of its nauseous
water. Then Wankanaga, seeing that it had been defiled,
took his club and smote a neighboring rock, and the rock
burst forth into clear bubbling water, so fresh and so
grateful to the palate that no other water can even be
compared to it.<a id="FNanchor_II-59" href="#Footnote_II-59" class="fnanchor">[II-59]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE GIANTS OF THE PALOUSE RIVER.</p>

<p>Passing into Washington, we find an account of the
origin of the falls of Palouse River and of certain native
tribes. There lived here at one time a family of giants,
four brothers and a sister. The sister wanted some
beaver-fat and she begged her brothers to get it for her&mdash;no
easy task, as there was only one beaver in the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">95</a></span>
country, and he an animal of extraordinary size and
activity. However, like four gallant fellows, the giants
set out to find the monster, soon catching sight of him near
the mouth of the Palouse, then a peaceful gliding river
with an even though winding channel. They at once
gave chase, heading him up the river. A little distance
up-stream they succeeded in striking him for the first time
with their spears, but he shook himself clear, making in his
struggle the first rapids of the Palouse, and dashed on
up-stream. Again the brothers overtook him, pinning him
to the river-bed with their weapons, and again the vigorous
beast writhed away, making thus the second falls
of the Palouse. Another chase, and, in a third and
fatal attack, the four spear-shafts are struck again through
the broad wounded back. There is a last stubborn
struggle at the spot since marked by the great falls called
Aputaput, a tearing of earth and a lashing of water in the
fierce death-flurry, and the huge Beaver is dead. The
brothers having secured the skin and fat, cut up the body
and threw the pieces in various directions. From these
pieces have originated the various tribes of the country,
as the Cayuses, the Nez Percés, the Walla Wallas, and
so on. The Cayuses sprang from the beaver's heart, and
for this reason they are more energetic, daring, and successful
than their neighbors.<a id="FNanchor_II-60" href="#Footnote_II-60" class="fnanchor">[II-60]</a></p>

<p>In Oregon the Chinooks and neighboring people tell
of a pre-human demon race, called Ulháipa by the
Chinooks, and Sehuiáb by the Clallams and Lummis.
The Chinooks say that the human race was created by
Italapas, the Coyote. The first men were sent into
the world in a very lumpish and imperfect state, their
mouth and eyes were closed, their hands and feet immovable.
Then a kind and powerful spirit called Ikánam,
took a sharp stone, opened the eyes of these poor
creatures, and gave motion to their hands and feet. He
taught them how to make canoes as well as all other
implements and utensils; and he threw great rocks into
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">96</a></span>
the rivers and made falls, to obstruct the salmon in their
ascent, so that they might be easily caught.<a id="FNanchor_II-61" href="#Footnote_II-61" class="fnanchor">[II-61]</a></p>

<p>Farther north among the Ahts of Vancouver Island,
perhaps the commonest notion of origin is that men at
first existed as birds, animals, and fishes. We are told of
a certain Quawteaht, represented somewhat contradictorily,
as the first Aht that ever lived, thickset and hairy-limbed,
and as the chief Aht deity, a purely supernatural
being, if not the creator, at least the maker and shaper
of most things, the maker of the land and the water,
and of the animals that inhabit the one or the
other. In each of these animals as at first created, there
resided the embryo or essence of a man. One day a
canoe came down the coast, paddled by two personages
in the, at that time, unknown form of men. The animals
were frightened out of their wits, and fled, each
from his house, in such haste that he left behind
him the human essence that he usually carried in his
body. These embryos rapidly developed into men; they
multiplied, made use of the huts deserted by the animals,
and became in every way as the Ahts are now. There
exists another account of the origin of the Ahts, which
would make them the direct descendants of Quawteaht
and an immense bird that he married&mdash;the great Thunder
Bird, Tootooch, with which, under a different name
and in a different sex, we shall become more familiar
presently. The flapping of Tootooch's wings shook the
hills with thunder, <i>tootah</i>; and when she put out her
forked tongue, the lightning quivered across the sky.</p>

<p>The Ahts have various legends of the way in which
fire was first obtained, which legends may be reduced to
the following: Quawteaht withheld fire, for some reason
or other, from the creatures that he had brought into the
world, with one exception; it was always to be found
burning in the home of the cuttle-fish, <i>telhoop</i>. The
other beasts attempted to steal this fire, but only the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">97</a></span>
deer succeeded; he hid a little of it in the joint of his
hind leg, and escaping, introduced the element to general
use.</p>

<p>Not all animals, it would appear, were produced in the
general creation; the loon and the crow had a special
origin, being metamorphosed men. Two fishermen,
being out at sea in their canoes, fell to quarreling, the
one ridiculing the other for his small success in fishing.
Finally the unsuccessful man became so infuriated by
the taunts of his companion that he knocked him on the
head, and stole his fish, cutting out his tongue before he
paddled off, lest by any chance the unfortunate should
recover his senses and gain the shore. The precaution was
well taken, for the mutilated man reached the land and
tried to denounce his late companion. No sound however
could he utter but something resembling the cry of a
loon, upon which the Great Spirit, Quawteaht, became
so indiscriminatingly angry at the whole affair that he
changed the poor mute into a loon, and his assailant
into a crow. So when the mournful voice of the loon
is heard from the silent lake or river, it is still the poor
fisherman that we hear, trying to make himself understood
and to tell the hard story of his wrongs.<a id="FNanchor_II-62" href="#Footnote_II-62" class="fnanchor">[II-62]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">NOOTKA AND SALISH CREATION-MYTHS.</p>

<p>The general drift of many of the foregoing myths
would go to indicate a wide-spread belief in the theory
of an evolution of man from animals.<a id="FNanchor_II-63" href="#Footnote_II-63" class="fnanchor">[II-63]</a> Traditions are
not wanting, however, whose teaching is precisely the
reverse. The Salish, the Nisquallies, and the Yakimas
of Washington, all hold that beasts, fishes, and even
edible roots are descended from human originals. One
account of this inverse Darwinian development is this:
The son of the Sun&mdash;whoever he may have been&mdash;caused
certain individuals to swim through a lake of magic oil,
a liquid of such Circean potency that the unfortunates
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">98</a></span>
immersed were transformed as above related. The
peculiarities of organism of the various animals, are the
results of incidents of their passage; the bear dived, and
is therefore fat all over; the goose swam high, and is
consequently fat only up to the water-line; and so on
through all the list.<a id="FNanchor_II-64" href="#Footnote_II-64" class="fnanchor">[II-64]</a></p>

<p>Moving north to the Tacullies of British Columbia,
we find the Musk-rat an active agent in the work of
creation. The flat earth, following the Tacully cosmogony,
was at first wholly covered with water. On the
water a Musk-rat swam to and fro, seeking food. Finding
none there, he dived to the bottom and brought up a
mouthful of mud, but only to spit it out again when he
came to the surface. All this he did again and again
till quite an island was formed and by degrees the whole
earth. In some unexplained way this earth became
afterwards peopled in every part, and so remained, until
a fierce fire of several days' duration swept over it, destroying
all life, with two exceptions; one man and one
woman hid themselves in a deep cave in the heart of a
mountain, and from these two has the world been since
repeopled.<a id="FNanchor_II-65" href="#Footnote_II-65" class="fnanchor">[II-65]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">YEHL, THE CREATOR OF THE THLINKEETS.</p>

<p>From the Tacully country we pass north and west
to the coast inhabited by the Thlinkeets, among whom
the myth of a great Bird, or of a great hero-deity, whose
favorite disguise is the shape of a bird, assumes the most
elaborate proportions and importance. Here the name
of this great Somebody is Yehl, the Crow or Raven,
creator of most things, and especially of the Thlinkeets.
Very dark, damp, and chaotic was the world in the
beginning; nothing with breath or body moved there
except Yehl; in the likeness of a raven he brooded over
the mist, his black wings beat down the vast confusion,
the waters went back before him and the dry land
appeared. The Thlinkeets were placed on the earth&mdash;though
how or when does not exactly appear&mdash;while the
world was still in darkness, and without sun or moon
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">99</a></span>
or stars. A certain Thlinkeet, we are further informed,
had a wife and a sister. Of the wife he was devouringly
jealous, and when employed in the woods at his
trade of building canoes, he had her constantly watched
by eight red birds of the kind called <i>kun</i>. To make
assurance surer, he even used to coop her up in a kind of
box every time he left home. All this while his sister,
a widow it would appear, was bringing up certain sons
she had, fine tall fellows, rapidly approaching manhood.
The jealous uncle could not endure the thought of their
being in the neighborhood of his wife. So he inveigled
them one by one, time after time, out to sea with him
on pretense of fishing, and drowned them there. The
poor mother was left desolate, she went to the sea-shore
to weep for her children. A dolphin&mdash;some say a whale&mdash;saw
her there, and pitied her; the beast told her to
swallow a small pebble and drink some sea-water. She
did so, and in eight months was delivered of a child.
That child was Yehl, who thus took upon himself a
human shape, and grew up a mighty hunter and notable
archer. One day a large bird appeared to him, having
a long tail like a magpie, and a long glittering bill
as of metal; the name of the bird was Kutzghatushl,
that is, Crane that can soar to heaven. Yehl shot the
bird, skinned it, and whenever he wished to fly used to
clothe himself in its skin.</p>

<p>Now Yehl had grown to manhood, and he determined
to avenge himself upon his uncle for the death of his
brothers; so he opened the box in which the well-guarded
wife was shut up. Instantly the eight faithful birds
flew off and told the husband, who set out for his home
in a murderous mood. Most cunning, however, in his
patience, he greeted Yehl with composure, and invited
him into his canoe for a short trip to sea. Having
paddled out some way, he flung himself on the young
man and forced him overboard: Then he put his canoe
about and made leisurely for the land, rid as he thought
of another enemy. But Yehl swam in quietly another
way, and stood up in his uncle's house. The baffled
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">100</a></span>
murderer was beside himself with fury, he imprecated
with a potent curse a deluge upon all the earth, well
content to perish himself so he involved his rival in
the common destruction, for jealousy is cruel as the
grave. The flood came, the waters rose and rose; but
Yehl clothed himself in his bird-skin, and soared up to
heaven, where he struck his beak into a cloud, and remained
till the waters were assuaged.</p>

<p class="sidenote">ADVENTURES OF YEHL AND KHANUKH.</p>

<p>After this affair Yehl had many other adventures, so
many that "one man cannot know them all," as the
Thlinkeets say. One of the most useful things he did
was to supply light to mankind&mdash;with whom, as appears,
the earth had been again peopled after the deluge. Now
all the light in the world was stored away in three
boxes, among the riches of a certain mysterious old
Chief, who guarded his treasure closely. Yehl set
his wits to work to secure the boxes; he determined to
be born into the chief's family. The old fellow had one
daughter upon whom he doted, and Yehl transforming
himself into a blade of grass, got into the girl's drinking-cup
and was swallowed by her. In due time she gave
birth to a son, who was Yehl, thus a second time born of
a woman into the world. Very proud was the old chief
of his grandson, loving him even as he loved his daughter,
so that Yehl came to be a decidedly spoiled child.
He fell a crying one day, working himself almost into a
fit; he kicked and scratched and howled, and turned
the family hut into a little pandemonium as only an
infant plague can. He screamed for one of the three
boxes; he would have a box; nothing but a box should
ever appease him! The indulgent grandfather gave him
one of the boxes; he clutched it, stopped crying, and
crawled off into the yard to play. Playing, he contrived
to wrench the lid off, and lo! the beautiful heaven was
thick with stars, and the box empty. The old man
wept for the loss of his stars, but he did not scold his
grandson, he loved him too blindly for that. Yehl had
succeeded in getting the stars into the firmament, and
he proceeded to repeat his successful trick, to do the like
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">101</a></span>
by the moon and sun. As may be imagined, the difficulty
was much increased; still he gained his end. He first
let the moon out into the sky, and some time afterward,
getting possession of the box that held the sun, he
changed himself into a raven and flew away with his
greatest prize of all. When he set up the blazing light
in heaven, the people that saw it were at first afraid.
Many hid themselves in the mountains, and in the
forests, and even in the water, and were changed into
the various kinds of animals that frequent these places.</p>

<p>There are still other feats of Yehl's replete with the
happiest consequences to mankind. There was a time,
for instance, when all the fire in the world was hid away
in an island of the ocean. Thither flew the indefatigable
deity, fetching back a brand in his mouth. The distance,
however, was so great that most of the wood was
burned away and a part of his beak, before he reached
the Thlinkeet shore. Arrived there, he dropped the
embers at once, and the sparks flew about in all directions
among various sticks and stones; therefore it is
that by striking these stones, and by friction on this wood,
fire is always to be obtained.</p>

<p>Light they now had, and fire; but one thing was still
wanting to men; they had no fresh water. A personage
called Khanukh<a id="FNanchor_II-66" href="#Footnote_II-66" class="fnanchor">[II-66]</a> kept all the fresh water in his well,
in an island to the east of Sitka, and over the mouth of
the well, for its better custody, he had built his hut.
Yehl set out to the island in his boat, to secure the water,
and on his way he met Khanukh himself, paddling along
in another boat. Khanukh spoke first: How long
hast thou been living in the world? Proudly Yehl
answered: Before the world stood in its place, I was
there. Yehl in his turn questioned Khanukh: But how
long hast thou lived in the world? To which Khanukh
replied: Ever since the time that the liver came out from
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">102</a></span>
below.<a id="FNanchor_II-67" href="#Footnote_II-67" class="fnanchor">[II-67]</a> Then said Yehl: Thou art older than I. Upon
this Khanukh, to show that his power was as great as
his age, took off his hat, and there rose a dense fog, so
that the one could no longer see the other. Yehl then
became afraid, and cried out to Khanukh; but Khanukh
answered nothing. At last when Yehl found himself
completely helpless in the darkness, he began to weep
and howl; upon which the old sorcerer put on his hat
again, and the fog vanished. Khanukh then invited
Yehl to his house, and entertained him handsomely with
many luxuries, among which was fresh water. The
meal over, host and guest sat down, and the latter began
a long relation of his many exploits and adventures.
Khanukh listened as attentively as he could, but the
story was really so interminable that he at last fell
asleep across the cover of his well. This frustrated
Yehl's intention of stealing the water while its owner
slept, so he resorted to another stratagem: he put some
filth under the sleeper, then waking him up, made him
believe he had bewrayed himself. Khanukh, whose own
nose abhorred him, at once hurried off to the sea to wash,
and his deceiver as quickly set about securing the precious
water. Just as All-father Odin, the Raven-god, stole
Suttung's mead, drinking it up and escaping in the form
of a bird, so Yehl drank what fresh water he could,
filling himself to the very beak, then took the form
of a raven and attempted to fly off through the chimney
of the hut. He stuck in the flue however, and Khanukh
returning at that instant recognized his guest in the
struggling bird. The old man comprehended the situation,
and quietly piling up a roaring fire, he sat down
comfortably to watch the choking and scorching of his
crafty guest. The raven had always been a white bird,
but so thoroughly was he smoked in the chimney on this
occasion that he has ever since remained the sootiest of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">103</a></span>
fowls. At last Khanukh watching the fire, became
drowsy and fell asleep; so Yehl escaped from the island
with the water. He flew back to the continent, where
he scattered it in every direction; and wherever small
drops fell there are now springs and creeks, while the
large drops have produced lakes and rivers. This is the
end of the exploits of Yehl; having thus done everything
necessary to the happiness of mankind, he returned
to his habitation, which is in the east, and into which no
other spirit, nor any man can possibly enter.</p>

<p>The existing difference in language between the Thlinkeets
and other people is one of the consequences of a
great flood&mdash;perhaps that flood already described as
having been brought on through the jealousy of the
canoe-builder. Many persons escaped drowning by
taking refuge in a great floating building. When the
waters fell, this vessel grounded upon a rock, and was
broken into two pieces; in the one fragment were left
those whose descendants speak the Thlinkeet language,
in the other remained all whose descendants employ a
different idiom.</p>

<p class="sidenote">CHETHL AND AHGISHANAKHOU.</p>

<p>Connected with the history of this deluge is another
myth in which a great Bird figures. When the waters
rose a certain mysterious brother and sister found it
necessary to part. The name of the brother was Chethl,
that is, Thunder or Lightning, and the name of the
sister was Ahgishanakhou, which means the Underground
Woman. As they separated Chethl said to her:
Sister, you shall never see me again, but while I live
you shall hear my voice. Then he clothed himself in
the skin of a great bird, and flew towards the south-west.
His sister climbed to the top of Mount Edgecomb,
which is near Sitka, and it opened and swallowed her
up, leaving a great hole, or crater. The world itself is
an immense flat plate supported on a pillar, and under
the world, in silence and darkness, this Under-ground
Woman guards the great pillar from evil and malignant
powers. She has never seen her brother since she left
the upper world, and she shall never see him again; but
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">104</a></span>
still, when the tempest sweeps down on Edgecomb, the
lightning of his eyes gleams down her crater-window,
and the thundering of his wings re-echoes through all her
subterranean halls.<a id="FNanchor_II-68" href="#Footnote_II-68" class="fnanchor">[II-68]</a></p>

<p>The Koniagas, north of the Thlinkeets, have their
legendary Bird and Dog&mdash;the latter taking the place
occupied in the mythology of many other tribes by the
wolf or coyote. Up in heaven, according to the Koniagas,
there exists a great deity called Shljam Schoa.
He created two personages and sent them down to the
earth, and the Raven accompanied them carrying light.
This original pair made sea, rivers, mountains, forests,
and such things. Among other places they made the
Island of Kadiak, and so stocked it that the present
Koniagas assert themselves the descendants of a Dog.<a id="FNanchor_II-69" href="#Footnote_II-69" class="fnanchor">[II-69]</a></p>

<p>The Aleuts of the Aleutian Archipelago seem to disagree
upon their origin. Some say that in the beginning
a Bitch inhabited Unalaska, and that a great Dog swam
across to her from Kadiak; from which pair the human
race have sprung. Others, naming the bitch-mother of
their race Mahakh, describe a certain Old Man, called
Iraghdadakh, who came from the north to visit this
Mahakh. The result of this visit was the birth of two
creatures, male and female, with such an extraordinary
mixing up of the elements of nature in them that they
were each half man, half fox. The name of the male
creature was Acagnikakh, and by the other creature he
became father of the human race. The Old Man however
seems hardly to have needed any help to people the
world, for like the great patriarch of Thessaly, he was
able to create men by merely casting stones on the earth.
He flung also other stones into the air, into the water,
and over the land, thus making beasts, birds, and fishes.
In another version of the narrative, the first father of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">105</a></span>
Aleuts is said to have fallen from heaven in the shape
of a dog.<a id="FNanchor_II-70" href="#Footnote_II-70" class="fnanchor">[II-70]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE DOG-ORIGIN OF THE HYPERBOREANS.</p>

<p>In the legends of the Tinneh, living inland, north-east
of the Koniagas, the familiar Bird and Dog again appear.
These legends tell us that the world existed at first as a
great ocean frequented only by an immense Bird, the
beating of whose wings was thunder, and its glance lightning.
This great flying monster descended and touched
the waters, upon which the earth rose up and appeared
above them; it touched the earth, and therefrom came
every living creature&mdash;except the Tinneh, who owe their
origin to a Dog. Therefore it is that to this day a dog's
flesh is an abomination to the Tinneh, as are also all
who eat such flesh. A few years before Captain Franklin's
visit they almost ruined themselves by following the
advice of some fanatic reformer. Convinced by him of
the wickedness of exacting labor from their near relations,
the dogs, they got rid at once of the sin and of
all temptation to its recommission, by killing every cur in
their possession.</p>

<p>To return to the origin of the Tinneh, the wonderful
Bird before mentioned made and presented to them a
peculiar arrow, which they were to preserve for all time
with great care. But they would not; they misappropriated
the sacred shaft to some common use, and immediately
the great Bird flew away never to return. With
its departure ended the Golden Age of the Tinneh&mdash;an
age in which men lived till their throats were worn
through with eating, and their feet with walking.<a id="FNanchor_II-71" href="#Footnote_II-71" class="fnanchor">[II-71]</a></p>

<p>Belonging to the Northern-Indian branch of the Tinneh
we find a narrative in which the Dog holds a prominent
place, but in which we find no mention at all of
the Bird: The earth existed at first in a chaotic state,
with only one human inhabitant, a woman who dwelt in
a cave and lived on berries. While gathering these one
day, she encountered an animal like a dog, which followed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">106</a></span>
her home. This Dog possessed the power of transforming
himself into a handsome young man, and in this
shape he became the father by the woman of the first
men. In course of time a giant of such height that his
head reached the clouds, arrived on the scene and fitted
the earth for its inhabitants. He reduced the chaos to
order; he established the land in its boundaries, he
marked out with his staff the position or course of the
lakes, ponds, and rivers. Next he slew the Dog and tore
him to pieces, as the four giants did the Beaver of the
Palouse River, or as the creating Æsir did Aurgelmir.
Unlike the four brothers, however, and unlike the sons
of Bör, this giant of the Tinneh used the fragments not
to create men or things, but animals. The entrails of
the dog he threw into the water, and every piece became
a fish; the flesh he scattered over the land, and every
scrap became an animal; the bits of skin he sowed upon
the wind, and they became birds. All these spread over
the earth, and increased and multiplied; and the giant
gave the woman and her progeny power to kill and eat
of them according to their necessities. After this he
returned to his place, and he has not since been heard
of.<a id="FNanchor_II-72" href="#Footnote_II-72" class="fnanchor">[II-72]</a></p>

<p>Leaving now this division of our subject, more particularly
concerned with cosmogony, it may not be amiss
to forestall possible criticism as to the disconnected manner
in which the various myths are given. I have but
to repeat that the mythology with which we have to
deal is only known in fragments, and to submit that a
broken statue, or even a broken shard, of genuine
or presumably genuine antiquity, is more valuable to
science and even to poetry, than the most skillful ideal
restoration.</p>

<p class="sidenote">INTERPRETATION OF MYTHS.</p>

<p>Further, the absence of any attempt to form a connected
whole out of the myths that come under our
notice cannot but obviate that tendency to alter in outline
and to color in detail which is so insensibly natural
to any mythographer prepossessed with the spirit of a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">107</a></span>
system. In advancing lastly the opinion that the disconnected
arrangement is not only better adapted toward
preserving the original myths in their integrity, but is
also better for the student, I may be allowed to close the
chapter with the second of the Rules for the Interpretation
of Mythes given by so distinguished an authority
as Mr. Keightley: "In like manner the mythes
themselves should be considered separately, and detached
from the system in which they are placed; for the single
mythes existed long before the system, and were the product
of other minds than those which afterwards set them
in connection, not unfrequently without fully understanding
them."<a id="FNanchor_II-73" href="#Footnote_II-73" class="fnanchor">[II-73]</a></p>

<p>Fetichism seems to be the physical philosophy of man
in his most primitive state. He looks on material things
as animated by a life analogous to his own, as having a
personal consciousness and character, as being severally
the material body that contains some immaterial essence
or soul. A child or a savage strikes or chides any object
that hurts him, and caresses the gewgaw that takes his
fancy, talking to it much as to a companion.</p>

<p class="sidenote">VAGARIES CONCERNING CELESTIAL BODIES.</p>

<p>Let there be something peculiar, mysterious, or dangerous
about the thing and the savage worships it, deprecates
its wrath and entreats its favor, with such ceremonies,
prayers, and sacrifices as he may deem likely to win
upon its regard. In considering such cases mythologically,
it will be necessary to examine the facts to see
whether we have to deal with simple fetichism or with
idolatry. That savage worships a fetich who worships
the heaving sea as a great living creature, or kneels to
flame as to a hissing roaring animal; but the Greeks in
conceiving a separate anthropomorphic god of the sea or
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">109</a></span>
of the fire, and in representing that god by figures of
different kinds, were only idolaters. The two things,
however, are often so merged into each other that it
becomes difficult or impossible to say in many instances
whether a particular object, for example the sun, is
regarded as the deity or merely as the representation or
symbol of the deity. It is plain enough, however, that
a tolerably distinct element of fetichism underlies much
of the Indian mythology. Speaking of this mythology
in the mass, the North American Review says: "A
mysterious and inexplicable power resides in inanimate
things. They, too, can listen to the voice of man, and
influence his life for evil or for good. Lakes, rivers, and
waterfalls are sometimes the dwelling-place of spirits,
but more frequently they are themselves living beings, to
be propitiated by prayers and offerings."<a id="FNanchor_III-1" href="#Footnote_III-1" class="fnanchor">[III-1]</a></p>

<p>The explicit worship of the sun and more or less that
of other heavenly bodies, or at least a recognition of
some supernatural power resident in or connected with
them, was widely spread through Mexico, as well among
the uncivilized as among the civilized tribes. The wild
Chichimecs or that portion of the wild tribes of Mexico to
which Alegre applied this name, owned the sun as their
deity, as did also the people of the Nayarit country.<a id="FNanchor_III-2" href="#Footnote_III-2" class="fnanchor">[III-2]</a></p>

<p>In what we may call civilized Mexico, the sun was
definitely worshiped under the name of Tonatiuh, the
Sun in his substance, and under that of Naolin, the Sun
in his four motions. He was sometimes represented by
a human face surrounded with rays, at other times by a
full-length human figure, while again he often seems to
be confused or connected with the element fire and the
god of fire. Sahagun, for instance, usually speaks of
the festival of the month Itzcalli as appertaining to the
god of fire, but in at least one place he describes it as
belonging to the sun and the fire.<a id="FNanchor_III-3" href="#Footnote_III-3" class="fnanchor">[III-3]</a> The sun, it is tolerably
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">110</a></span>
certain, held, if not the highest place, one not far
removed from that position in the Mexican pantheon.
Brasseur de Bourbourg, Tylor, Squier, and Schoolcraft
agree in considering sun-worship the most radical religious
idea of all civilized American religions.<a id="FNanchor_III-4" href="#Footnote_III-4" class="fnanchor">[III-4]</a> Professor
Müller considers the sun-god and the supreme
Mexican Teotl to be identical.<a id="FNanchor_III-5" href="#Footnote_III-5" class="fnanchor">[III-5]</a> Dr. Brinton, as we shall
see when we come to notice the mythology of fire, while
not denying the prominence of the sun-cult, would refer
that cult to a basal and original fire-worship. Many
interpreters of mythology see also the personification of
the sun in others of the Mexican gods besides Tonatiuh.
More especially does evidence seem to point strongly in
this direction in the case of Quetzalcoatl, as will be seen
when we come to deal with this god.</p>

<p>The Mexicans were much troubled and distressed by
an eclipse of the sun. They thought that he was much
disturbed and tossed about by something, and that he
was becoming seriously jaundiced. This was the occasion
of a general panic, women weeping aloud, and men
howling and shouting and striking the hand upon the
mouth. There was an immediate search for men with
white hair and white faces, and these were sacrificed to the
sun, amid the din and tumult of singing and musical instruments.
It was thought that should the eclipse become
once total, there would be an end of the light, and that
in the darkness the demons would come down to the
devouring of the people.<a id="FNanchor_III-6" href="#Footnote_III-6" class="fnanchor">[III-6]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">111</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">ECLIPSES, AND THEIR EFFECT ON MAN.</p>

<p>The Tlascaltecs, regarding the sun and the moon as
husband and wife, believed eclipses to be domestic quarrels,
whose consequences were likely to be fatal to the
world if peace could not be made before things proceeded
to an extremity. To sooth the ruffled spirit of the sun
when he was eclipsed, a human sacrifice was offered to
him of the ruddiest victims that could be found; and
when the moon was darkened she was appeased with
the blood of those white-complexioned persons commonly
known as Albinos.<a id="FNanchor_III-7" href="#Footnote_III-7" class="fnanchor">[III-7]</a></p>

<p>The idea of averting the evil by noise, in case of an
eclipse either of the sun or moon, seems to have been a
common one among other American tribes. Alegre
ascribes it to the natives of Sonora in general. Ribas
tells how the Sinaloas held that the moon in an eclipse
was darkened with the dust of battle. Her enemy had
come upon her, and a terrible fight, big with consequence
to those on earth, went on in heaven. In wild excitement
the people beat on the sides of their houses, encouraging
the moon and shooting flights of arrows up
into the sky to distract her adversary. Much the same
as this was also done by certain Californians.<a id="FNanchor_III-8" href="#Footnote_III-8" class="fnanchor">[III-8]</a></p>

<p>With regard to an eclipse of the moon the Mexicans
seem to have had rather special ideas as to its effects
upon unborn children. At such times, women who were
with child became alarmed lest their infant should be
turned into a mouse, and to guard against such an undesirable
consummation they held a bit of obsidian, <i>iztli</i>,
in their mouth, or put a piece of it in their girdle, so
that the child should be born perfect and not lipless, or
noseless, or wry-mouthed, or squinting, or a monster.<a id="FNanchor_III-9" href="#Footnote_III-9" class="fnanchor">[III-9]</a>
These ideas are probably connected with the fact that
the Mexicans worshiped the moon under the name of
Meztli, as a deity presiding over human generations.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">112</a></span>
This moon-god is considered by Clavigero to be identical
with Joaltecutli, god of night.<a id="FNanchor_III-10" href="#Footnote_III-10" class="fnanchor">[III-10]</a></p>

<p>It is to the Abbé Brasseur de Bourbourg, however, that
we must turn for a truly novel and cyclopean theory of
Mexican lunolatry. He sees back to a time when the
forefathers of American civilization lived in a certain
Crescent Land in the Atlantic; here they practiced
Sabaism. Through some tremendous physical catastrophe
their country was utterly overwhelmed by the
sea; and this inundation is considered by the abbé to
be the origin of the deluge-myths of the Central-American
nations. A remnant of these Crescent people saved
themselves in the seven principal islands of the Lesser
Antilles; these are, he explains, the seven mythical
caves or grottoes celebrated in so many American legends
as the cradle of the nations. The saved remnant of the
people wept the loss of their friends and of their old land,
making the latter, with its crescent shape, memorable forever
by adopting the moon as their god. "It is the
moon," writes the great Américaniste, "male and
female, Luna and Lunas, personified in the land of the
Crescent, engulfed in the abyss, that I believe I see at
the commencement of this amalgam of rites and symbols
of every kind."<a id="FNanchor_III-11" href="#Footnote_III-11" class="fnanchor">[III-11]</a> I confess inability to follow the path
by which the abbé has reached this conclusion; but I
have indicated its whereabouts, and future students may
be granted a further insight into this new labyrinth and
the subtleties of its industrious Dædalus.</p>

<p class="sidenote">WHAT THE MEXICANS THOUGHT OF STARS AND COMETS.</p>

<p>The Mexicans had many curious ideas about the stars,
some of which have come down to us. They particularly
reverenced a certain group of three called <i>mamalhoaztli</i>,
in, or in the neighborhood of, the sign Taurus of the
zodiac. This name was the same as that of the sticks
from which fire was procured: a resemblance of some
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">113</a></span>
kind being supposed to exist between them and these
stars. Connected again with this was the burning by
every male Mexican of certain marks upon his wrist, in
honor of the same stars; it being believed that the man
who died without these marks should, on his arrival in
hades, be forced to draw fire from his wrist by boring
upon it as on a fire-stick. The planet Venus was worshiped
as the first light that appeared in the world, as the
god of twilight, and, according to some, as being identical
with Quetzalcoatl. This star has been further said to
borrow its light from the moon, and to rise by four starts.
Its first twinkle was a bad augury, and to be closed out
of all doors and windows; on appearing for the third
time, it began to give a steady light, and on the fourth
it shone forth in all its clearness and brilliancy.</p>

<p>Comets were called each <i>citlalinpopoca</i>, or the smoking
star; their appearance was considered as a public
disaster, and as announcing pest, dearth, or the death of
some prince. The common people were accustomed to
say of one, This is our famine, and they believed it to
cast down certain darts, which falling on any animal,
bred a maggot that rendered the creature unfit for food.
All possible precautions of shelter were of course taken
by persons in positions exposed to the influence of these
noxious rays. Besides the foregoing, there were many
stars or groups of stars whose names were identical with
those of certain gods; the following seem to belong to
this class: Tonacatlecutli or Citlalalatonalli, the milky
way; Yzacatecutli, Tlahvizcalpantecutli, Ceyacatl, Achitumetl,
Xacupancalqui, Mixcoatl, Tezcatlipoca, and Contemoctli.<a id="FNanchor_III-12" href="#Footnote_III-12" class="fnanchor">[III-12]</a></p>

<p class="p2">I have already noticed a prevailing tendency to connect
the worship of fire and that of the sun. The rites
of a perpetual fire are found closely connected with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">114</a></span>
a sun-cult, and, whichever may be the older, it is certain
they are rarely found apart. "What," says Tylor, "the
sea is to Water-worship, in some measure the Sun is to
Fire-worship."<a id="FNanchor_III-13" href="#Footnote_III-13" class="fnanchor">[III-13]</a> Brinton would reverse this and give
to fire the predominance: in short, he says, the sun
"is always spoken of as a fire;" "and without danger
or error we can merge the consideration of its worship
almost altogether in this element."<a id="FNanchor_III-14" href="#Footnote_III-14" class="fnanchor">[III-14]</a> This sounds
rather extravagant and is hardly needed in any case;
for sufficient reason for its deification can always be
found in its mysterious nature and awful powers of
destruction, as well as in its kind and constantly
renewed services, if gratitude have any power in making
a god. The mere guarding and holding sacred
a particular fire probably originated in the importance
of possessing an unfailing source of the element, and in
the difficulty of its production if allowed to die out,
among men not possessed of the appliances of civilization.</p>

<p>When we come to review the gods in general, those
connected with fire will be pointed out as they appear;
for the present, let it suffice to say that many American
peoples had such gods, or had ceremonies suggesting
their existence and recognition, or lastly, had legends of
the origin or procurement of the fire they daily used on
the altar or on the hearth. In the Pueblos of New
Mexico, and more especially among the Pecos, sacred
perpetual fires were kept up by special command of
their traditionary god and ruler Montezuma; but these
fires were not regarded as fetiches.<a id="FNanchor_III-15" href="#Footnote_III-15" class="fnanchor">[III-15]</a> The Mexican
fire-god was known by the name of Xiuhtecutli, and
by other names appertaining to the different aspects
in which he was viewed. While preserving his own
well-marked identity, he was evidently closely related
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">115</a></span>
also to the sun-god. Many and various, even
in domestic life, were the ceremonies by which he
was recognized; the most important ritual in connection
with his service being, perhaps, the lighting of the new
fire, with which, as we shall see, the beginning of every
Mexican cycle was solemnized.<a id="FNanchor_III-16" href="#Footnote_III-16" class="fnanchor">[III-16]</a></p>

<p>There are various fables scattered up and down among
the various tribes regarding the origin or rather the procuring
of fire. We know how the Quichés received it
from the stamp of the sandal of Tohil; how, from the
home of the cuttle-fish, a deer brought it to the Ahts in
a joint of his leg; how from a distant island the great
Yehl of the Thlinkeets fetched the brand in his beak
that filled the flint and the fire-stick with seeds of eternal
fire.</p>

<p class="sidenote">HOW THE CAHROCS OBTAINED FIRE.</p>

<p>The Cahrocs hold that, when in the beginning the creator
Chareya made fire, he gave it into the custody of two
old hags, lest the Cahrocs should steal it. The Cahrocs,
having exhausted every means to procure the treasure,
applied for help to their old friend the Coyote; who,
having maturely considered how the theft might best
be accomplished, set about the thing in this way:
From the land of the Cahrocs to the home of the old
women he stationed a great company of animals, at
convenient distances; the strongest nearest the den of the
old beldames, the weakest farthest removed. Last of
all he hid a Cahroc in the neighborhood of the hut, and,
having left the man precise directions how to act, he
trotted up to the door and asked to be let in out of the
cold. Suspecting nothing, the crones gave him admittance;
so he lay down in front of the fire, and made
himself as comfortable as possible, waiting for the further
action of his human accomplice without. In good time,
the man made a furious attack on the house and the old
furies rushed out at once to drive off the invader. This
was the Coyote's opportunity. Instantly he seized a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">116</a></span>
half-burnt brand and fled like a comet down the trail; and
the two hags, seeing how they had been outwitted, turned
after him in immediate and furious chase. It had gone
hard then with the hopes of the Cahrocs, if their four-legged
Prometheus had trusted to his single speed; but
just as he began to feel the pace tell on him, and just as
the weird women thought they were about to recover
the brand, the Cougar relieved him of it. Great was
the satisfaction of our wise Coyote, as he sank down,
clearing his sooty eyes and throat, and catching his
breath, to see the great lithe cat leap away with the
torch, and the hags gnash their choppy gums as they
rushed by, hard in pursuit, on the dim trail of sparks.
The Cougar passed the brand to the Bear, the Bear to
his neighbor, and so on to the end. Down the long line
of carriers, the panting crones plied their withered old
legs in vain; only two mishaps occurring among all the
animals that made up the file. The squirrel, last in the
train but one, burned his tail so badly that it curled up
over his back, and even scorched the skin above his
shoulders. Last of all, the poor Frog, who received the
brand when it had burned down to a very little piece,
hopped along so heavily that his pursuers gained on him,
gained fast and surely. In vain he gathered himself for
every spring, in vain he stretched at every leap till the
jarred muscles cracked again. He was caught. The
smoke-dimmed eyes stood out from his head, his little
heart thumped like a club against the lean fingers that
closed upon his body&mdash;yet that wild croak was not the
croak of despair. Once more for the hope of the Cahrocs!
one more struggle for the Coyote that trusted
him in this great thing! and with a gulp the plucky
little martyr swallowed the fire, tore himself from the
hands that held him, leaped into a river, and diving
deep and long, gained his goal; but gained it a mournful
wreck, the handsome tail, which, of all his race,
only the tadpole should ever wear again, was utterly gone,
left, like that of an O'Shanter's mare, in the witch's
grasp; only the ghost of himself was left to spit out on
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">117</a></span>
some pieces of wood the precious embers preserved at so
great a cost. And it is because the Frog spat out this
fire upon these pieces of wood that it can always be
extracted again by rubbing them hard together.<a id="FNanchor_III-17" href="#Footnote_III-17" class="fnanchor">[III-17]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">FIRE, THE LIGHTNING, AND WIND.</p>

<p>The Navajos have a legend as to the procuring of fire,
that has many analogies to the foregoing. They tell
how, when they first gained the earth, they were without
fire, and how the Coyote, the Bat, and the Squirrel
agreed to procure it for them. The object of their desire
seems to have been in the possession of the animals in
general, in some distant locality. The Coyote, having
attached pine splinters to his tail, ran quickly through
the fire and fled with his lighted prize. Being keenly
pursued, however, by the other animals, he soon tired;
upon which the Bat relieved him, and dodging and
flitting here and there, carried the splinters still farther.
Then the Squirrel came to the assistance of the Bat, and
succeeding him in his office, contrived to reach the
hearths of the Navajos with the coveted embers.<a id="FNanchor_III-18" href="#Footnote_III-18" class="fnanchor">[III-18]</a></p>

<p>The natives of Mendocino county, California, believe
that lightning is the origin of fire, that a primeval bolt
hurled down by the Man Above fell upon certain wood,
from which, consequently fire can always be extracted by
rubbing two pieces together.<a id="FNanchor_III-19" href="#Footnote_III-19" class="fnanchor">[III-19]</a></p>

<p class="p2">From fire let us turn for a moment to wind, whose
phenomena, as might be expected, have not been allowed
to pass wholly unnoticed by the mythologies with which
we have to deal. When we come to examine ideas
connected with death and with the soul of man and its
future, we shall find the wind, or the air, often in use as
the best name and figure for the expression of primitive
conceptions of that mysterious thing, the vital essence or
spirit. The wind too is often considered as a god, or at
least as the breath of a god, and in many American
languages the Great Spirit and the Great Wind are one
and the same both in word and signification. The name
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">118</a></span>
of the god Hurakan, mentioned in Quiché myths, still
signifies the Storm in many a language strange to his
worshipers, while in Quiché it may be translated Spirit,
or swiftly moving Spirit;<a id="FNanchor_III-20" href="#Footnote_III-20" class="fnanchor">[III-20]</a> and the name of the Mexican
god Mixcoatl is said to be to this day the correct
Mexican term for the whirlwind.<a id="FNanchor_III-21" href="#Footnote_III-21" class="fnanchor">[III-21]</a></p>

<p>An interesting point here arises with regard to the
division of the heavens into four quarters and the naming
of these after the names of the wind. Dr. Brinton
believes this fact to be at the bottom of the sacredness
and often occurrence of the number four in so many
early legends, and he connects these four winds and
their embodiment in many quaternions of deities, with
the sacredness of the cross and its use among widely
separated nations, to whom its later Christian signification
was utterly unknown.<a id="FNanchor_III-22" href="#Footnote_III-22" class="fnanchor">[III-22]</a></p>

<p>If we may suppose that the Great Spirit and the wind
are often represented under the form of an enormous bird,
we must connect with them, as their most inseparable
attributes, the thunder and the lightning; the first, as
we have so often seen, is the rustling or stridor of the
wings of the bird, the second is the flashing of his eyes.
The Raven of the Koniagas is not, however, as among
most other tribes of the great Northwest, the author of
these things; but their principal deity when he is angry
sends down two dwarfs, who thunder and lighten
according to his command.<a id="FNanchor_III-23" href="#Footnote_III-23" class="fnanchor">[III-23]</a> Of the god Hurakan,
whom we have noticed as the etymon of the word hurricane,
the Popol Vuh says: "The flash is the first sign
of Hurakan; the second is the furrow of the flash; the
third is the thunderbolt that strikes;"<a id="FNanchor_III-24" href="#Footnote_III-24" class="fnanchor">[III-24]</a> and to the
Mexican god, Tlaloc, are also attached the same three
attributes.<a id="FNanchor_III-25" href="#Footnote_III-25" class="fnanchor">[III-25]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">119</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">WATER AS A PURIFYING ELEMENT.</p>

<p>Turning to water, we find it regarded among many
tribes as the first of elemental things. It is from a primeval
ocean of water that the earth is generally supposed
to come up. Water is obviously a first and chief
nourisher of vegetable life, and an indispensable prerequisite
of all fertility; from this it is but a short step to
saying that it is the mother of those that live by the
earth's fertility. "Your mother, Chalchiuhtlicue, goddess
of water," is a phrase constantly found in the midwife's
mouth, in her address to the child, in the Mexican
washing or baptismal service.<a id="FNanchor_III-26" href="#Footnote_III-26" class="fnanchor">[III-26]</a></p>

<p>The use of water more or less sanctified or set apart or
made worthy the distinction 'holy;' the employment of
this in a rite of avowed purification from inherent sin,
at the time of giving a name&mdash;baptism, in one word&mdash;runs
back to a period far pre-Christian among the
Mexican, Maya, and other American nations; as
ancient ceremonies to be hereafter described will show.
That man sets out in this life-journey of his with a
terrible bias toward evil, with a sad and pitiful liability
to temptation, is a point upon which all religions are
practically unanimous. How else could they exist?
Were man born perfect he would remain perfect, otherwise
the first element of perfection would be wanting;
and perfection admits of no superlative, no greater, no
god. Where there is a religion then, there is generally
a consciousness of sin voluntary and involuntary. How
shall I be cleansed? how shall my child be cleansed from
this great wickedness? is the cry of the idolater as well
as of the monotheist. Is it strange that the analogy between
corporal and spiritual pollution should independently
suggest itself to both? Surely not. Wash and
be clean, is to all the world a parable needing no interpreter.<a id="FNanchor_III-27" href="#Footnote_III-27" class="fnanchor">[III-27]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span></p>

<p>The ceremonial use of water followed the Mexican
through all his life; though for the present we shall
only notice one more custom connected with it, the last
of all. When a body was buried, a vase of clean, sweet
water was let down into the tomb; bright, clear, life-giving
and preserving water&mdash;hope and love, dumb and
inarticulate, stretching vague hand toward a resurrection.</p>

<p>The Mexican rain and water god was Tlaloc, sender
of thunder and lightning, lord of the earthly paradise,
and fertilizer of earth; his wife was the Chalchiuhtlicue,
already mentioned.<a id="FNanchor_III-28" href="#Footnote_III-28" class="fnanchor">[III-28]</a> Like Tlaloc was Quiateot, the
Nicaraguan rain-god, master of thunderbolts and general
director of meteorological phenomena.<a id="FNanchor_III-29" href="#Footnote_III-29" class="fnanchor">[III-29]</a></p>

<p>The Navajos puffed tobacco smoke straight up toward
heaven to bring rain, and those of them that carried a
corpse to burial were unclean till washed in water.<a id="FNanchor_III-30" href="#Footnote_III-30" class="fnanchor">[III-30]</a> In
a deep and lonely cañon near Fort Defiance there is a
spring that this tribe hold sacred, approaching it only
with much reverence and the performance of certain
mystic ceremonies. They say it was once a boiling
spring, and that even yet if approached heedlessly or by
a bad Indian, its waters will seethe up and leap forth to
overwhelm the intruder.<a id="FNanchor_III-31" href="#Footnote_III-31" class="fnanchor">[III-31]</a></p>

<p>The Zuñis had also a sacred spring; sacred to the rain-god,
who, as we see by implication, is Montezuma the
great Pueblo deity himself. No animal might taste of
its sacred waters, and it was cleansed annually with
vessels also sacred&mdash;most ancient vases that had been
transmitted from generation to generation since times to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">121</a></span>
which even tradition went not back. These vessels were
kept ranged on the wall of the well. The frog, the
rattlesnake, and the tortoise were depicted upon them,
and were sacred to the great patron of the place, whose
terrible lightning should consume the sacrilegious hand
that touched these hallowed relics.<a id="FNanchor_III-32" href="#Footnote_III-32" class="fnanchor">[III-32]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE EARTH, THE SEA, THE SKY.</p>

<p>We have seen how the Californian tribes believe
themselves descended from the very earth, how the bodiless
ancestor of the Tezcucans came up from the soil, how
the Guatemaltecs, Papagos, and Pimas were molded
from the clay they tread, and how the Navajos came to
light from the bowels of a great mountain near the river
San Juan. It seems long ago and often to have come
into men's mind that the over-arching heaven or
something there and the all-producing earth are, as it
were, a father and mother to all living creatures. The
Comanches call on the earth as their mother, and on the
Great Spirit as their father. The Mexicans used to
pray: Be pleased, O our Lord, that the nobles who may
die in the war be peacefully and pleasingly received by
the sun and the earth, who are the father and mother of
all.<a id="FNanchor_III-33" href="#Footnote_III-33" class="fnanchor">[III-33]</a> It was probably, again, with some reference to the
motherly function of the earth that the same people,
when an earthquake came, took their children by the
head or hand, and lifted them up saying: The earthquake
will make them grow.<a id="FNanchor_III-34" href="#Footnote_III-34" class="fnanchor">[III-34]</a> Sometimes they specified
a particular part of the earth as closer to them in this
relation than other parts. It is said that on the tenth
day of the month Quecholli, the citizens of Mexico and
those of Tlatelolco were wont to visit a hill called Cacatepec,
for they said it was their mother.<a id="FNanchor_III-35" href="#Footnote_III-35" class="fnanchor">[III-35]</a></p>

<p>As to the substance, arrangement, and so on of the
earth and sky there remain one or two ideas not already
given in connection with the general creation. The
Tlascaltecs, and perhaps others of the Anáhuac peoples,
believed that the earth was flat, and ending with the sea-shore,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">122</a></span>
was borne up by certain divinities, who when
fatigued relieved each other, and that as the burden was
shifted from shoulder to shoulder earthquakes occurred.
The sea and sky were considered as of one material, the sea
being more highly condensed; and the rain was thought
to fall not from clouds but from the very substance of
heaven itself.<a id="FNanchor_III-36" href="#Footnote_III-36" class="fnanchor">[III-36]</a> The Southern Californians believed that
when the Creator made the world he fixed it on the back
of seven giants, whose movements, as in the preceding
myth, caused earthquakes.<a id="FNanchor_III-37" href="#Footnote_III-37" class="fnanchor">[III-37]</a> The sky, according to certain
of the Yucatecs, was held up by four brothers called
each of them Bacab, in addition to their several names,
which seem to have been Kan, Muluc, Ix, and Cauac.
These four, God had placed at the four corners of the
world when he created it, and they had escaped when all
else were destroyed by flood.<a id="FNanchor_III-38" href="#Footnote_III-38" class="fnanchor">[III-38]</a></p>

<p>In the interior of the earth, in volcanoes, subterranean
gods were often supposed to reside. The Koniagas, for
example, held that the craters of Alaska were inhabited
by beings mightier then men, and that these sent forth
fire and smoke when they heated their sweat-houses or
cooked their food.<a id="FNanchor_III-39" href="#Footnote_III-39" class="fnanchor">[III-39]</a></p>

<p class="p2">The rugged majesty of hills and mountains has not
been without its effect on the reverential mind of the
American aborigines. Direct worship was unusual, but
several incidents must have already informed the reader
that a kind of sanctity is often attached to great elevations
in nature. A predilection for hills and mounds as
landmarks and fanes of tradition, and as places of worship,
was as common among the Americans as among the
people of the old world. The Choles of the province of
Itza had a hill in their country that they regarded as
the god of all the mountains, and on which they burned
a perpetual fire.<a id="FNanchor_III-40" href="#Footnote_III-40" class="fnanchor">[III-40]</a> The Mexicans, praying for rain, were
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">123</a></span>
accustomed to vow that they would make images of the
mountains if their petitions were favorably received;<a id="FNanchor_III-41" href="#Footnote_III-41" class="fnanchor">[III-41]</a>
and, in other points connected with their religion to show,
as has appeared and will appear both with them and
with other people, their recognition of a divinity abiding
on or hedging about the great peaks. What wonder,
indeed, that to the rude and awe-struck mind, the everlasting
hills seemed nearer and liker heaven than the
common-place level of earth? and that the wild man
should kneel or go softly there, as in the peculiar presence
of the Great Spirit? This is hardly a new feeling,
it seems an instinct and custom as old as religion.
Where went Abraham in that awful hour, counted to him
for righteousness through all the centuries? Where
smoked the thunderings and lightnings that heralded
the delivery of the Law, when the son of Amram talked
with Jehovah face to face, as a man talketh with his
friend? Whence saw a greater than Moses the kingdoms
of the world and the glory of them? whence, in the all-nights
that came after, did the prayers of the Christ
ascend? and where stood he when his raiment became
as no fuller on earth could white it; Moses and Elias
talking with him, and Peter so sore afraid?</p>

<p class="sidenote">HILLS AND MOUNTAIN RANGES.</p>

<p>Where hills were not found conveniently situated for
purposes of worship, they seem to have been counterfeited
after man's feeble fashion: from high-place and
mound, from pyramid and teocalli, since the morning
stars sang together, the smoke of the altar and the
censer has not ceased to ascend. But the day begins
to broaden out, and the mists of the morning flee
away; though the hills be not lowered, God is lifted
up. Yet they have their glory and their charm still
even to us, and to the savage they often appear as
the result of a special and several creation. We remember
how the Great Spirit made Mount Shasta as his
only worthy abiding-place on earth; and I give here
another legend of a much more trivial sort than the first,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">124</a></span>
telling how, not Mount Shasta alone, but all the mountains
of California were built and put into position:&mdash;<a id="FNanchor_III-42" href="#Footnote_III-42" class="fnanchor">[III-42]</a> At
a time when the world was covered with water there
existed a Hawk and a Crow and a very small Duck.
The latter, after diving to the bottom and bringing up a
beakful of mud, died; whereupon the Crow and the Hawk
took each a half of the mud that had been brought up,
and set to work to make the mountains. Beginning at
a place called Teheechaypah Pass, they built northwards,
the Hawk working on the eastern range and the Crow
on the western. It was a long and weary toil, but in
time the work was finished, and as they laid the last
peak the workers met at Mount Shasta. Then the Hawk
saw that there had been foul play somewhere, for the
western range was bigger than his; and he charged the
Crow with stealing some of his mud. But the smart
bird laughed a hoarse guffaw in the face of his eastern
brother, not even taking the trouble to disown the theft,
and chuckled hugely over his own success and western
enterprise. The honest Hawk was at his wits' end, and
he stood thinking with his head on one side for quite a
long time; then in an absent kind of way he picked up
a leaf of Indian tobacco and began to chew, and wisdom
came with chewing. And he strengthened himself
mightily, and fixed his claws in the mountains, and
turned the whole chain in the water like a great floating
wheel, till the range of his rival had changed places with
his, and the Sierra Nevada was on the east and the
Coast Range on the west, as they remain to this day.</p>

<p>This legend is not without ingenuity in its way but
there is more of human interest in the following pretty
story of the Yosemite nations, as to the origin of the
names and present appearance of certain peaks and other
natural features of their valley:&mdash;</p>

<p class="sidenote">TOTOKÓNULA AND TISAYAC OF YOSEMITE.</p>

<p>A certain Totokónula was once chief of the people
here: a mighty hunter and a good husbandman, his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">125</a></span>
tribe never wanted food while he attended to their welfare.
But a change came; while out hunting one day,
the young man met a spirit-maid, the guardian angel of
the valley, the beautiful Tisayac. She was not as the
dusky beauties of his tribe, but white and fair, with rolling
yellow tresses that fell over her shoulders like sunshine,
and blue eyes with a light in them like the sky
where the sun goes down. White, cloudlike wings were
folded behind her shoulders, and her voice was sweeter
than the song of birds; no wonder the strong chief loved
her with a mad and instant love. He reached toward
her, but the snowy wings lifted her above his sight, and
he stood again alone upon the dome, where she had been.</p>

<p>No more Totokónula led in the chase or heeded
the crops in the valley; he wandered here and there
like a man distraught, ever seeking that wonderful shining
vision that had made all else on earth stale and unprofitable
in his sight. The land began to languish,
missing the industrious directing hand that had tended
it so long; the pleasant garden became a wilderness
where the drought laid waste, and the wild beast spoiled
what was left, and taught his cubs to divide the prey.
When the fair spirit returned at last to visit her valley,
she wept to see the desolation, and she knelt upon the
dome, praying to the Great Spirit for succor. God
heard, and stooping from his place, he clove the dome
upon which she stood, and the granite was riven beneath
her feet, and the melted snows of the Nevada rushed
through the gorge, bearing fertility upon their cool bosom.
A beautiful lake was formed between the cloven walls of
the mountain, and a river issued from it to feed the
valley for ever. Then sang the birds as of old, laving their
bodies in the water, and the odor of flowers rose like a
pleasant incense, and the trees put forth their buds, and
the corn shot up to meet the sun and rustled when the
breeze crept through the tall stalks.</p>

<p>Tisayac moved away as she had come, and none knew
whither she went; but the people called the dome by
her name, as it is indeed known to this day. After her
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">126</a></span>
departure the chief returned from his weary quest; and
as he heard that the winged one had visited the valley,
the old madness crept up into his eyes and entered,
seven times worse than at the first, into his empty soul;
he turned his back on the lodges of his people. His last
act was to cut with his hunting-knife the outline of his
face upon a lofty rock, so that if he never returned his
memorial at least should remain with them forever. He
never did return from that hopeless search, but the
graven rock was called Totokónula, after his name,
and it may be still seen, three thousand feet high, guarding
the entrance of the beautiful valley.<a id="FNanchor_III-43" href="#Footnote_III-43" class="fnanchor">[III-43]</a></p>

<p>Leaving this locality and subject, I may remark that
the natives have named the Póhono Fall, in the same
valley, after an evil spirit; many persons having been
swept over and dashed to pieces there. No native of the
vicinity will so much as point at this fall when going
through the valley, nor could anything tempt one of
them to sleep near it; for the ghosts of the drowned are
tossing in its spray, and their wail is heard forever above
the hiss of its rushing waters.<a id="FNanchor_III-44" href="#Footnote_III-44" class="fnanchor">[III-44]</a></p>

<p>The reader must have already noticed the strange rôles
filled by animals in the creeds of the Native Races of the
Pacific States. Beasts and birds and fishes fetch and
carry, talk and act, in a way that leaves even Æsop's heroes
in the shade; while a mysterious and inexplicable influence
over human destiny is often accorded to them. It is of
course impossible to say precisely how much of all this is
metaphorical, and how much is held as soberly and
literally true. Probably the proportion varies all the
way from one extreme to the other among different
nations, and among peoples of different stages of culture
in the same nation. They spake only in part, these
priests and prophets of barbaric cults, and we can understand
only in part; we cannot solve the dark riddle of
the past; we can oftenest only repeat it, and even that in
a more or less imperfect manner.</p>

<p>The Mexicans had their official augurs and soothsayers,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">128</a></span>
who divined much as did their brethren of classic
times. The people also drew omen and presage from
many things: from the howling of wild beasts at night;
the singing of certain birds; the hooting of the owl; a
weasel crossing a traveler's path; a rabbit running into
its burrow; from the chance movements of worms, beetles,
ants, frogs, and mice; and so on in detail.<a id="FNanchor_IV-1" href="#Footnote_IV-1" class="fnanchor">[IV-1]</a></p>

<p>The owl seems to have been in many places considered
a bird of ill omen. Among all the tribes visited by Mr
Lord, from the Fraser River to the Saint Lawrence, this
bird was portentously sacred, and was a favorite decoration
of the medicine-men. To come on an owl at an
unusual time, in daylight for example, and to hear its
mystic cry, were things not desirable of any that loved
fulness of pleasure and length of days.<a id="FNanchor_IV-2" href="#Footnote_IV-2" class="fnanchor">[IV-2]</a> In California,
by the tribes on the Russian River, owls were held to be
devils or evil spirits incarnate.<a id="FNanchor_IV-3" href="#Footnote_IV-3" class="fnanchor">[IV-3]</a></p>

<p>We often find an animal adopted in much the same
way as a patron saint was selected by the mediæval knight.
The Hyperborean lad, for example, when he reaches manhood,
takes some beast or fish or bird to be his patron, and
the spirit connected with that animal is supposed to guard
him. Unlike most Indians, the Eskimo will have no
hesitation in killing an animal of his tutelary species:
he is only careful to wear a piece of its skin or bone,
which he regards as an amulet, which it were to him a
serious misfortune to lose. Prolonged ill luck sometimes
leads a man to change his patron beast for another.
The spirits connected with the deer, the seal, the salmon,
and the beluga are regarded by all with special veneration.<a id="FNanchor_IV-4" href="#Footnote_IV-4" class="fnanchor">[IV-4]</a></p>

<p>The Mexicans used to allot certain animals to certain
parts of the body; perhaps in much the same way as
astrologers and alchemists used to connect the stars of
heaven with different substances and persons. The following
twenty Mexican symbols were supposed to rule
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">129</a></span>
over the various members of the human body: The sign
of the deer, over the right foot; of the tiger, over the
left foot; of the eagle, over the right hand; of the
monkey, over the left hand; of death&mdash;represented by
a skull&mdash;over the skull; of water, over the hair; of the
house, over the brow; of rain, over the eyes; of the dog,
over the nose; of the vulture, over the right ear; of the
rabbit, over the left ear; of the earthquake, over the
tongue; of flint, over the teeth; of air, over the breath;
of the rose, over the breast; of the cane, over the heart;
of wind, over the lungs&mdash;as appears from the plate in the
Codex Vaticanus, the Italian interpreter giving, however,
"over the liver;" of the grass, over the intestines;
of the lizard, over the loins; and of the serpent, over the
genitals.<a id="FNanchor_IV-5" href="#Footnote_IV-5" class="fnanchor">[IV-5]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE HUMANITY OF ANIMALS.</p>

<p>Sometimes the whole life and being of a man was
supposed to be bound up in the bundle with that of some
animal. Thus, of the Guatemaltecs, old Gage quaintly
enough writes: "Many are deluded by the Devil to believe
that their life dependeth upon the life of such and
such a beast (which they take unto them as their familiar
spirit) and think that when that beast dieth they must
die; when he is chased their hearts pant; when he is
faint they are faint; nay it happeneth that by the devil's
delusion they appear in the shape of that beast."<a id="FNanchor_IV-6" href="#Footnote_IV-6" class="fnanchor">[IV-6]</a></p>

<p>Animals are sometimes only men in disguise; and
this is the idea often to be found at the bottom of that
sacredness which among particular tribes is ascribed to
particular animals.</p>

<p>The Thlinkeet will kill a bear only in case of great
necessity, for the bear is supposed to be a man that has
taken the shape of an animal. We do not know if they
think the same of the albatross, but they certainly will
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">130</a></span>
not kill this bird, believing, like mariners ancient and
modern, that such a misdeed would be followed by bad
weather.<a id="FNanchor_IV-7" href="#Footnote_IV-7" class="fnanchor">[IV-7]</a></p>

<p>Among the natives seen by Mr Lord on Vancouver Island,
ill-luck is supposed to attend the profane killing of
the ogress-squirrel, and the conjurers wear its skin as a
strong charm among their other trumpery. As tradition
tells, there once lived there a monstrous old woman with
wolfish teeth, and finger-nails like claws. She ate children,
this old hag, wiling them to her with cunning
and oily words, and many were the broken hearts and
empty cradles that she left. One poor Rachel, weeping
for her child and not to be comforted because it was not,
cries aloud: Oh, Great Spirit, Great Medicine, save my
son, in any way, in any form! And the great, good
Father, looking down upon the red mother pities her;
lo, the child's soft brown skin turns to fur, and there
slides from the ogress's grip no child, but the happiest,
liveliest, merriest little squirrel of all the west&mdash;but
bearing, as its descendants still bear, those four dark
lines along the back that show where the cruel claws
plowed into it escaping.<a id="FNanchor_IV-8" href="#Footnote_IV-8" class="fnanchor">[IV-8]</a></p>

<p>Where monkeys are found, the idea seems often to
have occurred to men, to account for the resemblance of
the monkey to the man by making of the first a fallen
or changed form of the latter. We have already seen
how the third Quiché destruction of the human race terminated
thus; and how the hurricane-ended Sun of the
Air in Mexican mythology, also left men in the apish
state. The intelligence of beavers may have been the
means of winning them a similar distinction. The Flathead
says these animals are a fallen race of Indians,
condemned for their wickedness to this form, but who
will yet, in the fulness of time, be restored to their humanity.<a id="FNanchor_IV-9" href="#Footnote_IV-9" class="fnanchor">[IV-9]</a></p>

<p>As we shall see more particularly, when we come to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">131</a></span>
deal with the question of the future life, it was a common
idea that the soul of the dead took an animal shape,
sometimes inhabiting another world, sometimes this.
The Thlinkeets, for example, believed that their shamáns
used to have interviews with certain spirits of the dead
that appeared to them in two forms, some as land animals,
some as marine.<a id="FNanchor_IV-10" href="#Footnote_IV-10" class="fnanchor">[IV-10]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">SACREDNESS OF CERTAIN BRUTES.</p>

<p>The Californians round San Diego will not eat the
flesh of large game, believing such animals are inhabited
by the souls of generations of people that have died ages
ago; 'eater of venison!' is a term of reproach among
them.<a id="FNanchor_IV-11" href="#Footnote_IV-11" class="fnanchor">[IV-11]</a></p>

<p>The Pimos and Maricopas had, if Bartlett's account
be correct, some curious and unusual ideas regarding
their future state; saying that the several parts of
the body should be changed into separate animals; the
head would perhaps take the form of an owl, the feet
become wolves, and so on.<a id="FNanchor_IV-12" href="#Footnote_IV-12" class="fnanchor">[IV-12]</a> The Moquis supposed that
at death they should be severally changed into animals&mdash;bears,
deer, and such beasts; which indeed, as we
have already seen, they believed to have been their original
form.<a id="FNanchor_IV-13" href="#Footnote_IV-13" class="fnanchor">[IV-13]</a></p>

<p>Different reasons are given by different tribes for
holding certain animals sacred; some of these we have
already had occasion to notice. Somewhat different
from most, however, is that given by the Northern-Indian
branch of the Tinneh, for not eating the flesh of foxes,
wolves, ravens, and so on. This tribe are accustomed to
abandon the bodies of their dead wherever they happen
to fall, leaving them to the maws of kites or of any other
animals of prey in the neighborhood; therefore nothing
but the extremest necessity can force any member of the
nation to make use of such animals as food.<a id="FNanchor_IV-14" href="#Footnote_IV-14" class="fnanchor">[IV-14]</a></p>

<p>Certain natives of Guatemala in the province of Acalán,
called by Villagutierre Mazotecas, kept deer in so tame a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">132</a></span>
state that they were easily killed by the least active soldiers.
These deer were held as sacred by the inhabitants; for
tradition told them that their greatest god had visited
them in this figure.<a id="FNanchor_IV-15" href="#Footnote_IV-15" class="fnanchor">[IV-15]</a> The Apaches greatly respect the
bear, neither killing him nor tasting his flesh. They
think that there are spirits of divine origin within or
connected with the eagle, the owl, and all birds perfectly
white. Swine, they hold to be wholly unclean.<a id="FNanchor_IV-16" href="#Footnote_IV-16" class="fnanchor">[IV-16]</a> Some
animals are sacred to particular gods: with the Zuñis,
the frog, the turtle, and the rattlesnake were either considered
as specially under the protection of Montezuma&mdash;here
considered as the god of rain&mdash;or they were themselves
the lesser divinities of water.<a id="FNanchor_IV-17" href="#Footnote_IV-17" class="fnanchor">[IV-17]</a></p>

<p>It is sometimes necessary to guard against being misled
by names. Thus the natives of Nicaragua had gods
whose name was that of a rabbit or a deer; yet these
animals were not considered as gods. The identity of
name went only to say that such and such were the gods
to be invoked in hunting such and such animals.<a id="FNanchor_IV-18" href="#Footnote_IV-18" class="fnanchor">[IV-18]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE WIND OR THUNDER BIRD.</p>

<p>The reader must have already noticed how important
is the part assigned to birds in our mythology, especially
in creation-myths. A great bird is the agent of the chief
deity, perhaps the chief deity himself. The sweep of
his wings is thunder; the lightnings are the glances of
his eyes.<a id="FNanchor_IV-19" href="#Footnote_IV-19" class="fnanchor">[IV-19]</a> Chipewyans, Thlinkeets, Atnas, Koltschanes,
Kenai, and other nations give this being great prominence
in their legends.</p>

<p>Brinton believes this bird to be the emblem of the wind,
to be "a relic of the cosmogonal myth which explained
the origin of the world from the action of the winds, under
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">133</a></span>
the image of the bird, on the primeval ocean;"<a id="FNanchor_IV-20" href="#Footnote_IV-20" class="fnanchor">[IV-20]</a> and
his view is probably correct in many cases.</p>

<p>The savage is ever ready to be smitten by natural
powers. Ignorant and agape with wonder, is it unnatural
that he should regard, with a superstitious awe and respect,
the higher and more peculiar animal gifts, relating
them to like physical powers, and managing to mix and
confuse the whole by a strange synthesis of philosophy?
Birds flew, the winds flew; the birds were of the kith of
the winds, and the winds were of the kin of the gods
who are over all. Poor, weary, painted man, who could
only toil dustily along, foot-sore and perhaps heart-sore,
with strange longings that venison and bear-meat could
not satisfy&mdash;was it very wonderful if the throbbing
music and upward flight of the clear-throated and swift-winged
were to him very mysterious and sacred things?
"All living beings," say the north-eastern Eskimos,
"have the faculty of soul, but especially the bird." From
the flight and song of birds, the Mexican divined and
shadowed forth the unborn shapes of the to-come. He
died too, if he died in an odor of warlike sanctity, in
the strong faith that his soul should ultimately take the
form of a bird and twitter through the ages in the purple
shadows of the trees of paradise.<a id="FNanchor_IV-21" href="#Footnote_IV-21" class="fnanchor">[IV-21]</a></p>

<p>The Kailtas on the south fork of the Trinity in California,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">134</a></span>
though they do not turn the soul into a bird, do
say that as it leaves the body a little bird carries it up to
the spirit-land.<a id="FNanchor_IV-22" href="#Footnote_IV-22" class="fnanchor">[IV-22]</a></p>

<p>The Spaniards of Vizcaino's expedition, in 1602,
found the Californians of Santa Catalina Island venerating
two great black crows, which, according to Señor
Galan, were probably a species of bird known in Mexico
as <i>rey de los zopilotes</i>, or king of turkey-buzzards; he
adding that these birds are still the objects of respect
and devotion among most Californian tribes.<a id="FNanchor_IV-23" href="#Footnote_IV-23" class="fnanchor">[IV-23]</a></p>

<p>As another symbol, sign, or type of the supernatural,
the serpent would naturally suggest itself at an early
date to man. Its stealthy, subtle, sinuous motion, the
glittering fascination of its eyes, the silent deathly thrust
of its channeled fangs&mdash;what marvel if the foolishest
of men, like the wisest of kings, should say "I know it
not; it is a thing too wonderful for me?" It seems to
be immortal: every spring-time it cast off and crept from
its former skin, a crawling unburnt ph&oelig;nix, a new animal.</p>

<p>Schwartz, of Berlin, affirms, from deep research in
Greek and German mythology, that the paramount
germinal idea in this wide-spread serpent-emblem is the
lightning, and Dr. Brinton develops the same opinion at
some length.<a id="FNanchor_IV-24" href="#Footnote_IV-24" class="fnanchor">[IV-24]</a></p>

<p>Tlaloc, the Aztec rain-god, held in his hand a serpent-shaped
piece of gold, representing most probably
the lightning. Hurakan, of the Quiché legends,
is otherwise the Strong Serpent, he who hurls
below, referring in all likelihood to storm powers as
thunderer.<a id="FNanchor_IV-25" href="#Footnote_IV-25" class="fnanchor">[IV-25]</a> This view being accepted, the lightning-serpent
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">135</a></span>
is the type of fruitfulness; the thunder
storm being inseparably joined with the thick, fertilizing
summer showers.<a id="FNanchor_IV-26" href="#Footnote_IV-26" class="fnanchor">[IV-26]</a> Born, too, in the middle
heaven, of a cloud mother and of an Ixion upon whom
science cannot yet place her finger, amid moaning breeze
and threatening tempest, the lightning is surely also
akin to the wind and to the bird that is their symbol.
The amalgamation of these powers in one deity seems to
be what is indicated by such names as Quetzalcoatl,
Gucumatz, Cukulcan, all titles of the God of the Air in
different American languages, and all signifying 'Bird-Serpent.'</p>

<p class="sidenote">THE CROSS AND THE FOUR WINDS.</p>

<p>In a tablet on the wall of a room at Palenque is a
cross surmounted by a bird, and supported by what appears
to be the head of a serpent: "The cross," says
Brinton, "is the symbol of the four winds; the bird and
serpent, the rebus of the air god, their ruler."</p>

<p>It does not appear that savages attach any special significance
of evil to the snake, though the prepossessions
of early writers almost invariably blind them on this
point.<a id="FNanchor_IV-27" href="#Footnote_IV-27" class="fnanchor">[IV-27]</a> This rule is not without its exceptions however;
the Apaches hold that every rattlesnake contains the
soul of a bad man or is an emissary of the Evil Spirit.<a id="FNanchor_IV-28" href="#Footnote_IV-28" class="fnanchor">[IV-28]</a>
The Piutes of Nevada have a demon-deity in the form
of a serpent still supposed to exist in the waters of Pyramid
Lake. The wind when it sweeps down among the
nine islands of the lake drives the waters into the most
fantastic swirls and eddies, even when the general surface
of the lake is tolerably placid. This, say the Piutes, is
the devil-snake causing the deep to boil like a pot; this
is the old serpent seeking whom he may devour; and no
native in possession of his five sober wits will be found
steering toward those troubled waters at such a time.<a id="FNanchor_IV-29" href="#Footnote_IV-29" class="fnanchor">[IV-29]</a></p>

<p>In the Pueblo cities, among the Pecos especially, there
existed in early times an immense serpent, supposed to
be sacred, and which, according to some accounts, was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">136</a></span>
fed with the flesh of his devotees. Gregg heard an
"honest ranchero" relate how, one snowy morning, he
had come upon this terrible reptile's trail, "large as that
of a dragging ox;" the ranchero did not pursue the investigation
farther, not obtruding his science, such as it
was, upon his religion. This serpent was supposed to
be specially connected with Montezuma, and with rain
phenomena: it is often called "the great water-snake."
It was described to Whipple "as being as large round
as a man's body; and of exceeding great length, slowly
gliding upon the water, with long wavy folds" like the
Nahant sea-serpent&mdash;to Möllhausen, as being a great
rattlesnake, possessor of power over seas, lakes, rivers and
rain; as thick as many men put together, and much
longer than all the snakes in the world; moving in great
curves and destroying wicked men. The Pueblo Indians
prayed to it for rain and revered its mysterious
powers.<a id="FNanchor_IV-30" href="#Footnote_IV-30" class="fnanchor">[IV-30]</a></p>

<p>A people, called by Castañeda Tahus, apparently of
Sinaloa in the neighborhood of Culiacan, regarded certain
large serpents with sentiments of great veneration
if not of worship.<a id="FNanchor_IV-31" href="#Footnote_IV-31" class="fnanchor">[IV-31]</a> These reptiles seem also to have
been regarded with considerable reverence in Yucatan.
In 1517, Bernal Diaz noticed many figures of serpents in
a temple he saw at Campeche. Juan de Grijalva, also,
found at the same time many such figures at Champoton,
among other idols of clay and wood.<a id="FNanchor_IV-32" href="#Footnote_IV-32" class="fnanchor">[IV-32]</a></p>

<p>We have already spoken of the Mexican Tlaloc and of
the frequent appearance of the serpent in his worship;
it does not appear, however, notwithstanding Mr Squier's
assertion to the contrary, that the serpent was actually
worshiped either in Yucatan or Mexico. Bernal
Diaz, indeed, says positively in one passage, speaking of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">137</a></span>
a town called Tenayuca, that "they worshiped here, in
their chief temple, three serpents;" but the stout soldier
was not one to make fine distinctions between gods and
their attributes or symbols; nor, even with the best intentions,
was he or any other of the conquistadores in a
position to do justice to the faith of 'gentiles.'<a id="FNanchor_IV-33" href="#Footnote_IV-33" class="fnanchor">[IV-33]</a></p>

<p>We shall hereafter find the serpent closely connected
with Quetzalcoatl in many of his manifestations, as well
as with others of the Mexican gods.</p>

<p class="sidenote p2">THE DOG OF AMERICAN MYTHOLOGY.</p>

<p class="p2">From the serpent let us turn to the dog, with his relations
the wolf and coyote, an animal holding a respectable
place in American mythology. We have seen how
many tribes derive, figuratively or literally, their origin
from him, and how often he becomes legendarily important
as the hero of some adventure or the agent of some
deity. He is generally brought before us in a rather
benevolent aspect, though an exception occurs to this in
the case of the Chinooks at the mouth of the Columbia.
With these the coyote figures as the chosen medium for
the action of the Evil Spirit toward any given malevolent
end&mdash;as the form taken by the Evil One to counteract
some beneficence of the Good Spirit toward the
poor Indian whom he loves.<a id="FNanchor_IV-34" href="#Footnote_IV-34" class="fnanchor">[IV-34]</a></p>

<p>Very different from this is the character of that Coyote
of the Cahrocs whose good deeds we have so often had
occasion to set forth. One feat of his yet remains to be
told&mdash;how he stocked the river with salmon. Chareya,
the creator, had made salmon, but he had put them in
the big-water, and made a great fish-dam at the mouth
of the Klamath, so that they could not go up; and this
dam was closed with something of the nature of a white
man's key, which key was given in charge to two old
hags, not wholly unfamiliar to us, to keep and watch
over it night and day, so that no Cahroc should get near
it. Now fish being wanting to the Cahrocs, they were
sorely pushed by hunger, and the voice of women and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">138</a></span>
little children was heard imploring food. The Coyote
determined to help them; he swore by the stool of Chareya
that before another moon their lodges should drip
with salmon, and the very dogs be satisfied withal. So
he traveled down the Klamath many days' journey till
he came to the mouth of the river and saw the big-water
and heard the thunder of its waves. Up he went to the
hut of the old women, rapped, and asked hospitality for
the night; and he was so polite and debonair that the
crones could find no excuse for refusing him. He
entered the place and threw himself down by the fire,
warming himself while they prepared salmon for supper,
which they ate without offering him a bite. All night
long he lay by the fire pretending to sleep, but thinking
over his plans and waiting for the event that should put
him in possession of the mighty key that he saw hanging
so high above his reach. In the morning one of the
hags took down the key and started off toward the dam
to get some fish for breakfast. Like a flash the Coyote
leaped at her, hurling himself between her feet; heels
over head she pitched, and the key flew far from her
hands. Before she well knew what had hurt her the
Coyote stood at the dam with the key in his teeth,
wrenching at the fastenings. They gave way; and with a
great roar the green water raced through, all ashine with
salmon, utterly destroying and breaking down the dam,
so that ever after fish found free way up the Klamath.</p>

<p class="sidenote">COYOTES MUST NOT DANCE WITH STARS.</p>

<p>The end of the poor Coyote was rather sad, considering
his kindness of heart and the many services he had rendered
the Cahrocs. Like too many great personages, he
grew proud and puffed up with the adulation of flatterers
and sycophants&mdash;proud of his courage and cunning, and
of the success that had crowned his great enterprises for
the good of mankind&mdash;proud that he had twice deceived
and outwitted the guardian hags to whom Chareya had
entrusted the fire and the salmon&mdash;so proud that he
determined to have a dance through heaven itself, having
chosen as his partner a certain star that used to pass
quite close by a mountain where he spent a good deal of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">139</a></span>
his time. So he called out to the star to take him by
the paw and they would go round the world together for
a night; but the star only laughed, and winked in an
excessively provoking way from time to time. The
Coyote persisted angrily in his demand, and barked and
barked at the star all round heaven, till the twinkling
thing grew tired of his noise and told him to be quiet
and he should be taken next night. Next night the star
came quite up close to the cliff where the Coyote stood,
who leaping was able to catch on. Away they danced
together through the blue heavens. Fine sport it was
for a while; but oh, it grew bitter cold up there for a
Coyote of the earth, and it was an awful sight to look
down to where the broad Klamath lay like a slack bowstring
and the Cahroc villages like arrow-heads. Woe
for the Coyote! his numb paws have slipped their hold
on his bright companion; dark is the partner that leads
the dance now, and the name of him is Death. Ten
long snows the Coyote is in falling, and when he strikes
the earth he is "smashed as flat as a willow-mat".&mdash;Coyotes
must not dance with stars.<a id="FNanchor_IV-35" href="#Footnote_IV-35" class="fnanchor">[IV-35]</a></p>

</p>

<p>We now come to the broadest, whether or not it
be the most important, branch of our subject, namely,
the gods and spirits that men worship or know of.
Commencing at the extreme north, we shall follow
them through the various nations of our territory
toward the south. Very wild and conflicting is the
general mass of evidence bearing on a belief in
supernatural existences. Not only from the nature
of the subject is it allied to questions and matters
the most abstruse and transcendental&mdash;in the expression
of which the exactest dialectic terminology
must often be at fault; much more the rude and stammering
speech of savages&mdash;but it is also apt to call up
prejudices of the most warping and contradictory kind
in the minds of those through whose relation it must
pass to us. However hopeless the task, I will strive to
hold an equal beam of historical truth, and putting away
speculations of either extreme, try to give the naked
expression of the belief of the peoples we deal with&mdash;however
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">141</a></span>
stupid, however absurd&mdash;and not what they
ought to believe, or may be supposed to believe, according
to the ingenious speculations of different theorists.</p>

<p class="sidenote">ESKIMO SHAMANISM.</p>

<p>The Eskimos do not appear to recognize any supreme
deity, but only an indefinite number of supernatural
beings varying in name, power, and character&mdash;the evil
seeming to predominate. They carry on the person a
small ivory image rudely carved to represent some animal,
as a kind of talisman; these are thought to further
success in hunting, fishing and other pursuits, but can
hardly be looked upon with any great reverence, as they
are generally to be bought of their owners for a reasonable
price. All supernatural business is transacted through
the medium of shamáns;&mdash;functionaries answering to the
medicine-men of eastern Indian tribes;&mdash;of these there are
both male and female, each practising on or for the benefit
of his or her own respective sex. The rites of their
black art differ somewhat, according to Dall, from those
of their Tinneh neighbors, and very much from those of
the Tschuktschi and other Siberian tribes; and their
whole religion may be summed up as a vague fear finding
its expression in witchcraft.<a id="FNanchor_V-1" href="#Footnote_V-1" class="fnanchor">[V-1]</a></p>

<p>The Tinneh, that great people stretching north of the
fifty-fifth parallel nearly to the Arctic Ocean and to the
Pacific, do not seem in any of their various tribes to have
a single expressed idea with regard to a supreme power.
The Loucheux branch recognize a certain personage, resident
in the moon, whom they supplicate for success in
starting on a hunting expedition. This being once lived
among them as a poor ragged boy that an old woman
had found and was bringing up; and who made himself
ridiculous to his fellows by making a pair of
very large snow-shoes; for the people could not see what
a starveling like him should want with shoes of such
unusual size. Times of great scarcity troubled the hunters,
and they would often have fared badly had they not
invariably on such occasions come across a new broad
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">142</a></span>
trail that led to a head or two of freshly killed game.
They were glad enough to get the game and without
scruples as to its appropriation; still they felt curious as
to whence it came and how. Suspicion at last pointing
to the boy and his great shoes, as being in some way
implicated in the affair, he was watched. It soon
became evident that he was indeed the benefactor of the
Loucheux, and the secret hunter whose quarry had so
often replenished their empty pots; yet the people were
far from being adequately grateful, and continued to
treat him with little kindness or respect. On one occasion
they refused him a certain piece of fat&mdash;him who had
so often saved their lives by his timely bounty! That night
the lad disappeared, leaving only his clothes behind, hanging
on a tree. He returned to them in a month, however,
appearing as a man and dressed as a man. He told
them that he had taken up his home in the moon; that
he would always look down with a kindly eye to their
success in hunting; but he added, that as a punishment
for their shameless greed and ingratitude in refusing him
the piece of fat, all animals should be lean the long winter
through, and fat only in summer; as has since been
the case.</p>

<p class="sidenote">SPIRITS WITH THE KONIAGAS AND TINNEH.</p>

<p>According to Hearne, the Tinneh believe in a kind of
spirits, or fairies, called <i>nantena</i>, which people the earth,
the sea, and the air, and are instrumental for both good
and evil. Some of them believe in a good spirit called
Tihugun, 'my old friend,' supposed to reside in the sun
and in the moon; they have also a bad spirit, Chutsain,
apparently only a personification of death, and for this
reason called bad.</p>

<p>They have no regular order of shamáns; any one when
the spirit moves him may take upon himself their duties
and pretensions, though some by happy chances, or peculiar
cunning, are much more highly esteemed in this regard
than others, and are supported by voluntary contributions.
The conjurer often shuts himself in his tent
and abstains from food for days till his earthly grossness
thins away, and the spirits and things unseen are constrained
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">143</a></span>
to appear at his behest. The younger Tinneh
care for none of these things; the strong limb and the
keen eye, holding their own well in the jostle of life,
mock at the terrors of the invisible; but as the pulses
dwindle with disease or age, and the knees strike together
in the shadow of impending death, the shamán is hired
to expel the evil things of which the patient is possessed.
Among the Tacullies, a confession is often resorted to at
this stage, on the truth and accuracy of which depend
the chances of a recovery. As Harmon says, "the crimes
which they most frequently confess discover something
of their moral character and therefore deserve to be
mentioned;" but in truth I cannot mention them; both
with women and with men a filthiness and bestiality
worse than the sins of Sodom and Gomorrah defy the
stomach of description. The same thing is true of the
tedious and disgusting rites performed by the Tinneh
shamáns over the sick and at various other emergencies.
They blow on the invalid, leap about him or upon him,
shriek, sing, groan, gesticulate, and foam at the mouth,
with other details of hocus-pocus varying indefinitely
with tribe and locality. The existence of a soul is for
the most part denied, and the spirits with whom dealings
are had are not spirits that were ever in or of men;
neither are they regarded by men with any sentiment of
love or kindly respect; fear and self-interest are the
bonds&mdash;where any bonds exist&mdash;that link the Tinneh
with powers supernal or infernal.<a id="FNanchor_V-2" href="#Footnote_V-2" class="fnanchor">[V-2]</a></p>

<p>The Koniagas have the usual legion of spirits haunting
water, earth, and air, whose wrath is only to be appeased
by offerings to the shamáns; and sometimes,
though very rarely, by human sacrifices of slaves. They
have also a chief deity or spirit, called Shljam Schoá,
and a power for evil called Eyak.<a id="FNanchor_V-3" href="#Footnote_V-3" class="fnanchor">[V-3]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">144</a></span></p>

<p>Of the Aleuts, it is said that their rites showed a much
higher religious development than was to be found among
any of their neighbors; the labors of the Russian priests
have, however, been successful enough among them to
obliterate all remembrance of aught but the outlines of
their ancient cult. They recognize a creator-god, but
without worshiping him; he had made the world, but
he did not guide it; men had nothing to do any longer
with him, but only with the lesser <i>kugans</i>, or spirits, to
whom the direction and care of earthly affairs have been
committed. The stars and the sun and the moon were
worshiped, or the spirits of them among others, and
avenged themselves on those that adored them not. The
offended sun smote the eyes of a scoffer with blindness,
the moon stoned him to death, and the stars constrained
him to count their number&mdash;hopeless task that always
left the victim a staring maniac. The shamáns do not
seem to have enjoyed that distinction among the Aleuts
that their monopoly of mediation between man and the
invisible world gave them among other nations. They
were generally very poor, living in want and dying in
misery; they had no part nor lot in the joys or sorrows
of social life; never at feast, at wedding, or at a funeral
was their face seen. They lived and wandered men forbid,
driven to and fro by phantoms that were their masters
and not their slaves. The Aleuts had no permanent
idols, nor any worshiping-places built with hands; near
every village was some sanctified high place or rock,
sacred as a Sinai against the foot of woman or youth,
and whoever profaned it became immediately mad or
sick to death. Only the men and the old men visited
the place leaving there their offerings of skins or feathers
with unknown mysterious ceremonies.</p>

<p>The use of amulets was universal; and more than
shield or spear to the warrior going to battle was a belt
of sea-weed woven in magic knots. What a philosopher's
stone was to a Roger Bacon or a Paracelsus, was the
<i>tkhimkee</i>, a marvelous pebble thrown up at rare intervals
by the sea, to the Aleutian hunter. No beast could
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">145</a></span>
resist its attraction; he that carried it had no need to
chase his prey, he had only to wait and strike as the
animal walked up to its death. Another potent charm
was grease taken from a dead man's body; the spearhead
touched with this was sure to reach a mortal spot
in the whale at which it was hurled.</p>

<p class="sidenote">ALEUTIAN MYSTERY-DANCE.</p>

<p>There are dim Aleutian traditions of certain religious
night dances held in the month of December. Wooden
idols, or figures of some kind, were made for the occasion
and carried from island to island with many esoteric
ceremonies. Then was to be seen a marvelous sight.
The men and women were put far apart; in the middle of
each party a wooden figure was set up; certain great
wooden masks or blinders were put on each person, so
contrived that the wearer could see nothing outside a
little circle round his feet. Then every one stripped,
and there upon the snow, under the moonlight, in the
bitter Arctic night, danced naked before the image&mdash;say
rather before the god, for as they danced a kugan
descended and entered into the wooden figure. Woe to
him or to her whose drift-wood mask fell, or was lifted,
in the whirl of that awful dance; the stare of the Gorgon
was not more fatal than a glance of the demon that
possessed the idol; and for any one to look on one of the
opposite sex, however it came about, he might be even
counted as one dead. When the dance was over, the
idols and the masks were broken and cast away. It
may be added that such masks as this were needed, even
by prophets in their interviews with the great spirits
that know all mortal consequences; and that when a
man died such a mask was put over his eyes&mdash;O naked
and shivering soul, face to face with the darkest kugan
of all we will shelter thee what we can.<a id="FNanchor_V-4" href="#Footnote_V-4" class="fnanchor">[V-4]</a></p>

<p>The Thlinkeets are said not to believe in any supreme
being. They have that Yehl, the Raven, and that Khanukh,
the Wolf, whom we are already to some extent
acquainted with; but neither the exact rank and character
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">146</a></span>
of these in the supernatural world, nor even their
comparative rank, can be established above contradiction.
Thus Yehl is said to be the creator of all beings and
things, yet we have not forgotten how Khanukh wrung
from the unwilling lips of him the confession: Thou art
older that I. It is again said of Yehl that his power is
unlimited; but alas, we have seen him helpless in the
magic darkness raised by Khanukh, and howling as a
frightened child might do in a gloomy corridor. The
nature of Yehl is kind and he loves men, while the reverse
is generally considered true of Khanukh; but Yehl,
too, when his anger is stirred up sends sickness and evil
fortune. Yehl existed before his birth upon earth; he
cannot die nor even become older. Where the sources
of the Nass are, whence the east-wind comes, is Nass-Shakieyehl,
the home of Yehl; the east-wind brings
news of him. By an unknown mother a son was born
to him, who loves mankind even more than his father,
and provides their food in due season. To conclude the
matter, Yehl is, if not the central figure, at least the
most prominent in the Thlinkeet pantheon, and the
alpha and the omega of Thlinkeet philosophy and theology
is summed up in their favorite aphorism: As Yehl
acted and lived, so also will we live and do. After
Yehl and Khanukh, the Thlinkeets believe in the brother
and sister, Chethl and Ahgishanakhou, the Thunder or
Thunder-bird, and the Under-ground Woman. Chethl
is a kind of great northern rukh that snatches up and
swallows a whale without difficulty, while his wings and
eyes produce thunder and lightning as already described;
his sister Ahgishanakhou sits alone below and guards
the Irminsul that supports the world of the North-west.<a id="FNanchor_V-5" href="#Footnote_V-5" class="fnanchor">[V-5]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE THLINKEET SHAMÁN.</p>

<p>The Thlinkeets have no idols, unless the little images
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">147</a></span>
sometimes carried by the magicians for charming with
may be called by that name; they have no worship
nor priests, unless their sorcerers and the rites of them
may be entitled to these appellations. These sorcerers
or shamáns seem to be much respected; their words and
actions are generally believed and acquiesced in by all;
though the death of a patient or victim, or supposed victim,
is sometimes avenged upon them by the relatives of
the deceased. Shamánism is mostly hereditary; as a natural
course of things the long array of apparatus, masks,
dresses, and so on, is inherited by the son or grandson
of the deceased conjurer. The young man must, however,
prove himself worthy of his position before it becomes
assured to him, by calling up and communicating
with spirits. The future shamán retires into a lonely
forest or up some mountain, where he lives retired, feeding
only on the roots of the <i>panax-horridum</i>, and waiting
for the spirits to come to him, which they are generally
supposed to do in from two to four weeks. If all go well
the meeting takes place, and the chief of the spirits sends
to the neophyte a river-otter, in the tongue of which
animal is supposed to be hid the whole power and secret
of shamánism. The man meets the beast face to face,
and four times, each time in a different fashion, he pronounces
the syllable 'Oh!' Upon this the otter falls instantly,
reaching out at the same time its tongue, which
the man cuts off and preserves; hiding it away in a close
place, for if any one not initiated should look on this
talisman the sight would drive him mad. The otter is
skinned by the new shamán and the skin kept for a sign
of his profession, while the flesh is buried; it was unlawful
to kill a river-otter save on such occasions as
have been described. If, however, the spirits will not
visit the would-be shamán, nor give him any opportunity
to get the otter-tongue as described above, the neophyte
visits the tomb of a dead shamán and keeps an awful
vigil over night, holding in his living mouth a finger of
the dead man or one of his teeth; this constrains the
spirits very powerfully to send the necessary otter.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">148</a></span>
When all these things have been done the shamán returns
to his family emaciated and worn out, and his new
powers are immediately put to the test. His reputation
depends on the number of spirits at his command. The
spirits are called <i>yek</i>, and to every conjurer a certain
number of them are attached as familiars, while there
are others on whom he may call in an emergency; indeed
every man of whatever rank or profession is
attended by a familiar spirit or demon, who only abandons
his charge when the man becomes exceedingly bad.
The world of spirits in general is divided into three
classes: <i>keeyek</i>, <i>tákeeyek</i>, and <i>tékeeyek</i>. The first-class,
'the Upper Ones,' dwell in the north and seem
to be connected with the northern lights; they are
the spirits of the brave fallen in battle. The other two
classes are the spirits of those that died a natural death,
and their dwelling is called <i>takankóu</i>. The tákeeyek,
'land-spirits,' appear to the shamáns in the form of land
animals. With regard to the tékeeyek, 'sea-spirits'
which appear in the form of marine animals, there is
some dispute among the Thlinkeets as to whether these
spirits were ever the spirits of men like those of the other
two classes, or whether they were merely the souls of sea
animals.</p>

<p>The supreme feat of a conjurer's power is to throw one
of his liege spirits into the body of one who refuses to
believe in his power; upon which the possessed is taken
with swooning and fits. The hair of a shamán is never
cut. As among the Aleuts, a wooden mask is necessary
to his safe intercourse with any spirit; separate masks
are worn for interviews with separate spirits. When a
shamán sickens, his relatives fast for his recovery; when
he dies, his body is not burned like that of other men,
but put in a box which is set up on a high frame. The
first night following his death his body is left in that
corner of his hut in which he died. On the second
night it is carried to another corner, and so on for four
nights till it has occupied successively all the corners of
the yourt, all the occupants of which are supposed to fast
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">149</a></span>
during this time. On the fifth day the body is tied
down on a board, and two bones that the dead man had
often used in his rites when alive are stuck, the one in
his hair and the other in the bridge of his nose. The
head is then covered with a willow basket, and the body
taken to its place of sepulture, which is always near the
sea-shore; no Thlinkeet ever passes the spot without
dropping a little tobacco into the water to conciliate the
manes of the mighty dead.<a id="FNanchor_V-6" href="#Footnote_V-6" class="fnanchor">[V-6]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">SOLAR SPIRIT OF THE HAIDAHS.</p>

<p>The Haidahs believe the great solar spirit to be the
creator and supreme ruler; they do not however confuse
him with the material sun, who is a shining man walking
round the fixed earth and wearing a "radiated"
crown. Sometimes the moon is also connected in a confused
indefinite way with the great spirit. There is
an evil spirit who, according to Dunn, is provided
with hoofs and horns, though nothing is said as to the
fashion of them, whether orthodox or not. The Haidahs,
at least those seen by Mr Poole on Queen Charlotte Island,
have no worship, nor did they look upon themselves
as in any way responsible to any deity for their actions.
As with their northern neighbors, a belief in goblins,
spectres, and sorcery seems to be the sum of their religion.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">150</a></span></p>

<p>With some at least of the Haidahs there was in existence
a rite of this sorcery attended by circumstances of
more than ordinary barbarity and ferocity. When the
salmon season is over and the provisions of winter have
been stored away, feasting and conjuring begin. The
chief&mdash;who seems to be the principal sorcerer, and indeed
to possess little authority save from his connection with
the preterhuman powers&mdash;goes off to the loneliest and
wildest retreat he knows of or can discover in the mountains
or forest, and half starves himself there for some
weeks till he is worked up to a frenzy of religious insanity
and the <i>nawloks</i>&mdash;fearful beings of some kind not
human&mdash;consent to communicate with him by voices or
otherwise. During all this observance, the chief is called
<i>taamish</i>, and woe to the unlucky Haidah who happens
by chance so much as to look on him during its continuance;
even if the taamish do not instantly slay the intruder,
his neighbors are certain to do so when the thing
comes to their knowledge, and if the victim attempt to
conceal the affair, or do not himself confess it, the most
cruel tortures are added to his fate. At last the inspired
demoniac returns to his village, naked save a bear-skin
or a ragged blanket, with a chaplet on his head and a
red band of alder-bark about his neck. He springs on
the first person he meets, bites out and swallows one or
more mouthfuls of the man's living flesh wherever he
can fix his teeth, then rushes to another and another,
repeating his revolting meal till he falls into a torpor from
his sudden and half-masticated surfeit of flesh. For
some days after this he lies in a kind of coma, "like an
over-gorged beast of prey," as Dunn says; the same
observer adding that his breath during that time is
"like an exhalation from a grave." The victims of this
ferocity dare not resist the bite of the taamish; on the
contrary, they are sometimes willing to offer themselves
to the ordeal, and are always proud of its scars.<a id="FNanchor_V-7" href="#Footnote_V-7" class="fnanchor">[V-7]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">NOOTKA GODS.</p>

<p>The Nootkas acknowledge the existence of a great personage
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">151</a></span>
called Quahootze, whose habitation is apparently
in the sky, but of whose nature little is known. When
a storm begins to rage dangerously the Nootkas climb to
the top of their houses and looking upwards to this great
god, they beat drums and chant and call upon his name,
imploring him to still the tempest. They fast, as something
agreeable to the same deity, before setting out on
the hunt, and, if their success warrant it, hold a feast in
his honor after their return. This festival is held usually
in December, and it was formerly the custom to finish it
with a human sacrifice, an atrocity now happily fallen
into disuse; a boy, with knives stuck through the superficial
flesh of his arms, legs, and sides, being exhibited as
a substitute for the ancient victim.</p>

<p>Matlose is a famous hob-goblin of the Nootkas; he is
a very Caliban of spirits; his head is like the head of
something that might have been a man but is not; his
uncouth bulk is horrid with black bristles; his monstrous
teeth and nails are like the fangs and claws of a bear.
Whoever hears his terrible voice falls like one smitten,
and his curved claws rend a prey into morsels with a
single stroke.</p>

<p>The Nootkas, like so many American peoples, have a
tradition of a supernatural teacher and benefactor, an
old man that came to them up the Sound long ago. His
canoe was copper, and the paddles of it copper; every
thing he had on him or about him was of the same metal.
He landed and instructed the men of that day in many
things; telling them that he came from the sky, that
their country should be eventually destroyed, that they
should all die, but after death rise and live with him
above. Then all the people rose up angry, and took his
canoe from him, and slew him; a crime from which their
descendants have derived much benefit, for copper and
the use of it have remained with them ever since. Huge
images, carved in wood, still stand in their houses intended
to represent the form and hold in remembrance
the visit of this old man&mdash;by which visit is not improbably
intended to be signified an avatar or incarnation
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">152</a></span>
of that chief deity, or great spirit, worshiped by many
Californian tribes as 'the Old Man above.'</p>

<p>The Ahts regard the moon and the sun as their
highest deities, the moon being the husband and the
sun the wife. To the moon chiefly, as the more
powerful deity, they pray for what they require; and to
both moon and sun, as to all good deities, their prayers
are addressed directly and without the intervention of
the sorcerers. Quawteaht&mdash;which seems to be a local Aht
modification of Quahootze&mdash;who made most things
that are in the world, was the first to teach the people to
worship these luminaries who, over all and seeing all,
are more powerful than himself, though more distant
and less active. There is also that Tootooch, thunder-bird,
of which so much has been already said.</p>

<p>The Nootkas, in general, believe in the existence of
numberless spirits of various kinds, and in the efficacy
of sorcery. As in neighboring nations, the shamán
gains or renews his inspiration by fasting and solitary
meditation in some retired place, re-appearing at the end
of his vigil half-starved and half-insane, but filled with
the black virtue of his art. He does not generally collect
a meal of living human flesh like the taamish of the
preceding family, but he is satisfied with what his teeth
can tear from the corpses in the burial-places. Old
women are admitted to a share in the powers of sorcery
and prophecy and the interpretation of omens and dreams;
the latter a most important function, as few days and
nights pass over a Nootka house that do not give occasion
by some vision or occurrence for the office of the sibyl or
the augur.<a id="FNanchor_V-8" href="#Footnote_V-8" class="fnanchor">[V-8]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">153</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">PARADISE LOST OF THE OKANAGANS.</p>

<p>The Okanagans believe in a good spirit or master of
life, called Elemehumkillanwaist or Skyappe; and in
a bad spirit Kishtsamah or Chacha; both moving constantly
through the air, so that nothing can be done
without their knowledge. The Okanagans have no worship
public or private, but before engaging in anything
of importance they offer up a short prayer to the good
spirit for assistance; again on state occasions, a pipe is
passed round and each one smokes three whiffs toward
the rising sun, the same toward the setting, and the same
respectively toward the heaven above and the earth
beneath. Then they have their great mythic ruler and
heroine, Scomalt, whose story is intimately connected with
a kind of Okanagan fall or paradise lost. Long ago, so
long ago that the sun was quite young and very small
and no bigger than a star, there was an island far out at
sea called Samahtumiwhoolah, or the White Man's
Island. It was inhabited by a white race of gigantic
stature, and governed by a tall fair woman called Scomalt;
and she was a great and strong 'medicine,' this
Scomalt. At last the peace of the island was destroyed
by war, and the noise of battle was heard, the white men
fighting the one with the other; and Scomalt was exceedingly
wroth. She rose up and said: lo, now I will drive
these wicked far from me; my soul shall be no longer
vexed concerning them, neither shall they trouble the
faithful of my people with their strivings any more.
And she drove the rebellious together to the uttermost
end of the island, and broke off the piece of land on
which they were huddled, and pushed it out to sea to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">154</a></span>
drift whither it would. This floating island was tossed
to and fro many days and buffeted of the winds exceedingly,
so that all the people thereon died save one man
and one woman, who, seeing their island was ready to
sink, made themselves a canoe and gat them away toward
the west. After paddling day and night for many
suns, they came to certain islands, whence steering
through them, they came at last to where the mainland
was, being the territory that the Okanagans now inhabit;
it was, however, much smaller in those days, having
grown much since. This man and woman were so sorely
weather-beaten when they landed that they found their
original whiteness quite gone, and a dusky reddish color
in its place. All the people of the continent are descended
from this pair, and the dingy skin of their storm-tossed
ancestors has become a characteristic of the race.
And even, as in time past the wrath of the fair Scomalt
loosed the island of their ancestors from its mainland,
and sent it adrift with its burden of sinful men, so in
a time to come, the deep lakes, that like some Hannibal's
vinegar soften the rocks of the foundations of the world,
and the rivers that run for ever and gnaw them away,
shall set the earth afloat again; then shall the end of the
world be, the awful <i>itsowleigh</i>.<a id="FNanchor_V-9" href="#Footnote_V-9" class="fnanchor">[V-9]</a></p>

<p>The Salish tribes believe the sun to be the chief deity,
and certain ceremonies, described by Mr Lord as having
taken place on the death of a chief, seem to indicate that
fire is in some way connected with the great light.<a id="FNanchor_V-10" href="#Footnote_V-10" class="fnanchor">[V-10]</a> The
chief is ex officio a kind of priest, presiding for the most
part at the various observances by which the deity of the
sun is recognized. There is the usual belief in sorcery
and second sight, and individuals succeed, by force of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">155</a></span>
special gifts for fasting and lonely meditation, in having
themselves accounted conjurers&mdash;an honor of dubious
profit, as medicine-men are constantly liable to be shot
by an enraged relative of any one whose death they may
be supposed to have brought about.</p>

<p class="sidenote">DEITIES OF THE CLALLAMS.</p>

<p>The Clallams, a coast tribe on the mainland opposite
the south end of Vancouver Island, have a principal
good deity called by various names, and an evil spirit
called Skoocoom; to these some add a certain Teyutlma,
'the genius of good fortune.' The medicine-men of the
tribe are supposed to have much influence both for good
and evil with these spirits and with all the demon race,
or <i>sehuiáb</i> as the latter are sometimes called. In this
tribe the various conjurers are united by the bonds of a
secret society, the initiation into which is attended by a
good deal of ceremony and expense. Three days and
three nights must the novice of the order fast alone in a
mysterious lodge prepared for him, round which during
all that time the brethren already initiated sing and
dance. This period elapsed, during which it would seem
that the old nature has been killed out of him, he is
taken up like one dead and soused into the nearest cold
water, where he is washed till he revives; which thing
they call "washing the dead." When his senses are
sufficiently gathered to him, he is set on his feet; upon
which he runs off into the forest, whence he soon reappears
a perfect medicine-man, rattle in hand and decked
out with the various trappings of his profession. He
then parts all his worldly gear among his friends, himself
henceforth to be supported only by the fees of his new
calling.<a id="FNanchor_V-11" href="#Footnote_V-11" class="fnanchor">[V-11]</a></p>

<p>Ikánam, the creator of the universe, is a powerful deity
among the Chinooks, who have a mountain named after
him from a belief that he there turned himself into stone.
After him, or before him as many say, comes Italapas,
the Coyote, who created men after an imperfect fashion,<a id="FNanchor_V-12" href="#Footnote_V-12" class="fnanchor">[V-12]</a>
taught them how to make nets and catch salmon, how to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">156</a></span>
make a fire, and how to cook; for this the first fruits of the
fishing season are always sacred to him, and his figure is
to be found carved on the head of almost every Chinook
canoe on the Columbia. They have a fire-spirit, an evil
spirit, and a body of familiar spirits, <i>tamanowas</i>. Each
person has his special spirit, selected by him at an early
age, sometimes by fasting and other mortification of the
flesh, sometimes by the adoption of the first object the
child or young man sees, or thinks he sees, on visiting
the woods. These spirits have a great effect on the
imagination of the Chinooks, and their supposed directions
are followed under pain of mysterious and awful
punishments; people converse&mdash;"particularly when in the
water"&mdash;with them, apparently talking to themselves in
low monotonous tones. Some say that when a man dies
his tamanowa passes to his son; but the whole matter
is darkened with much mystery and secrecy; the name
of one's familiar spirit or guardian never being mentioned
even to the nearest friend. A similar custom forbids
the mention of a dead man's name, at least till many
years have elapsed after the bereavement.</p>

<p>The Chinook medicine-men are possessed of the usual
powers of converse and mediation with the spirits good
and evil; there are two classes of them, employed in
all cases of sickness&mdash;the <i>etaminuas</i>, or priests, who intercede
for the soul of the patient, and, if necessary, for
its safe passage to the land of spirits&mdash;and the <i>keelalles</i>,
or doctors, sometimes women, whose duty it is to administer
medical as well as spiritual aid.<a id="FNanchor_V-13" href="#Footnote_V-13" class="fnanchor">[V-13]</a></p>

<p>With the Cayuses and the Walla-Wallas any one may
become a medicine-man; among the Nez Percés the office
belongs to an hereditary order. Women are sometimes
trained to the profession, but they are not believed to
hold such extreme powers as the males, nor are they
murdered on the supposed exercise of some fatal influence.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">157</a></span>
For, as with the Chinooks<a id="FNanchor_V-14" href="#Footnote_V-14" class="fnanchor">[V-14]</a> so here, the reputation
of sorcerer is at once the most terrible to others and
the most dangerous to one's self that one can have. His
is a power of life, and death; his evil eye can wither and
freeze a hated life if not as swiftly at least as surely as
the stare of the Medusa; he is mortal, however&mdash;he can
slay your friend or yourself, and death is bitter, but then
how sweet an anodyne is revenge! There is no strong
magic can avail when the heart's blood trickles down the
avenger's shaft, no cunning enchantment that can keep
the life in when his tomahawk crumbles the skull like a
potsherd&mdash;and so it comes about that the conjurers walk
everywhere with their life in their hand, and are constrained
to be very wary in their exercise of their nefarious
powers.<a id="FNanchor_V-15" href="#Footnote_V-15" class="fnanchor">[V-15]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">SHOSHONE DEMONS.</p>

<p>The Shoshone legends people certain parts of the
mountains of Montana with little imps or demons called
<i>ninumbees</i>, who are about two feet long, perfectly naked,
and provided each with a tail. These limbs of the evil
one are accustomed to eat up any unguarded infant they
may find, leaving in its stead one of their own baneful
race. When the mother comes to suckle what she supposes
to be her child, the fiendish changeling seizes her
breast and begins to devour it; then, although her screams
and the alarm thereby given soon force the malicious
imp to make his escape, there is no hope further; she
dies within the twenty-four hours, and if not well watched
in the meantime, the little demon will even return
and make an end of her by finishing his interrupted
meal. There is another variety of these hobgoblins
call <i>pahonahs</i>, 'water-infants,' who devour women and
children as do their brother-fiends of the mountain, and
complete the ring of ghoulish terror that closes round the
Shoshone child and mother.<a id="FNanchor_V-16" href="#Footnote_V-16" class="fnanchor">[V-16]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">158</a></span></p>

<p>The Californian tribes, taken as a whole, are pretty
uniform in the main features of their theogonic beliefs.
They seem, without exception, to have had a hazy conception
of a lofty, almost supreme being; for the most
part referred to as a Great Man, the Old Man Above, the
One Above; attributing to him, however, as is usual in
such cases, nothing but the vaguest and most negative
functions and qualities. The real, practical power that
most interested them, who had most to do with them and
they with him, was a demon, or body of demons, of a tolerably
pronounced character. In the face of divers assertions
to the effect that no such thing as a devil proper has ever
been found in savage mythology, we would draw attention
to the following extract from the <i>Pomo</i> manuscript of
Mr Powers&mdash;a gentleman who, both by his study and by
personal investigation, has made himself one of the best
qualified authorities on the belief of the native Californian,
and whose dealings have been for the most part with
tribes that have never had any friendly intercourse with
white men:&mdash;"Of course the thin and meagre imagination
of the American savages was not equal to the creation
of Milton's magnificent imperial Satan, or of Goethe's
Mephistopheles, with his subtle intellect, his vast powers,
his malignant mirth; but in so far as the Indian fiends
or devils have the ability, they are wholly as wicked as
these. They are totally bad, they have no good thing
in them, they think only evil; but they are weak and
undignified and absurd; they are as much beneath Satan
as the 'Big Indians' who invent them are inferior in
imagination to John Milton."<a id="FNanchor_V-17" href="#Footnote_V-17" class="fnanchor">[V-17]</a></p>

<p>A definite location is generally assigned to the evil
one as his favorite residence or resort; thus the Californians
in the county of Siskiyou, give over Devil's
Castle, its mount and lake, to the malignant spirits, and
avoid the vicinity of these places with all possible care.</p>

<p class="sidenote">SACRED FIRES.</p>

<p>The medicine-man of these people is a personage of some
importance, dressing in the most costly furs; he is a non-combatant,
not coming on the field till after the fight; among
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">159</a></span>
other duties, it is absolutely necessary for him to visit any
camp from which the tribe has been driven by the
enemy, there to chant the death-song and appease the
angry spirit that wrought this judgment of defeat, for
only after this has been done is it thought safe to light
again the lodge-fires on the old hearths. Once lit these
lodge-fires are never allowed to go out during times of
peace; it would be a bad omen, and omens are everything
with these men, and deducible from all things.
The power of prophecy is thoroughly believed in, and is
credited not only to special seers, but also to distinguished
warriors going into battle; in the latter case, as far at
least as their own several fate is concerned; this, according
to Mr Miller, they often predict with startling accuracy.<a id="FNanchor_V-18" href="#Footnote_V-18" class="fnanchor">[V-18]</a></p>

<p>There is a strange sacredness mixed up with the sweat-house
and its use, among the Cahrocs, the Eurocs, and
many other tribes. The men of every village spend the
winter and rainy season in its warm shelter; but squaws
are forbidden to enter, under penalty of death, except when
they are initiated into the ranks of the 'medicines.'
So consistent are the Indians in this matter, that women
are not allowed even to gather the wood that is to be burned
in the sacred fire of a sweat-house; all is done by men, and
that only with certain precautions and ceremonies. The
sacred fire is lit every year in September by a 'medicine'
who has gone out into the forest and fasted and
meditated for ten days; and, till a certain time has
elapsed, no secular eye must behold so much as the smoke
of it under awful penalties. The flame once burning is
never suffered to go out till the spring begins to render
further heat unnecessary and inconvenient.</p>

<p>On one only occasion is the ban lifted from the head
of women; when a female is being admitted to the medicine
ranks, she is made to dance in the sweat-house
till she falls exhausted. It does not appear, however,
that even by becoming a medicine can she hope to see
twice the interior of this lodge.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">160</a></span></p>

<p>The admission of a man to the medicine is a much
severer affair. He must retire to the forest for ten days,
eating no meat the while, and only enough acorn-porridge
to keep the life in him; the ten days past, he returns to
the sweat-house and leaps up and down till he falls, just
as the woman did.</p>

<p>The doctors or sorcerers are of two kinds, 'root doctors'
and 'barking doctors.' To the barking doctor falls the
diagnosis of a case of sickness. He, or she, squats down
opposite the patient, and barks at him after the manner
of an enraged cur, for hours together. If it be a poisoning
case, or a case of malady inflicted by some conjurer,
the barking doctor then goes on to suck the evil thing out
through the skin or administer emetics, as may be
deemed desirable. If the case, however, be one of less
serious proportions, the 'barker,' after having made his
diagnosis, retires, and the root-doctor comes in, who, with
his herbs and simples and a few minor incantations, proceeds
to cure the ailment. If a patient die, then the
medicine is forced to return his fee; and if he refuse
to attend on anyone and the person die, then he is forced
to pay to the relatives a sum equal to that which was
tendered to him as a fee in the beginning of the affair;
thus like all professions, that of a medicine has its
draw-backs as well as advantages.</p>

<p>Several Northern Californian tribes have secret societies
which meet in a lodge set apart, or in a sweat-house,
and engage in mummeries of various kinds, all to frighten
their women. The men pretend to converse with the
devil, and make their meeting-place shake and ring again
with yells and whoops. In some instances, one of their
number, disguised as the master fiend himself, issues from
the haunted lodge, and rushes like a madman through
the village, doing his best to frighten contumacious
women and children out of their senses. This, it would
seem, has been going on from time immemorial and the
poor women are still gulled by it, and even frightened
into more or less prolonged fits of wifely propriety and
less easy virtue.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">161</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">CALIFORNIAN DEITIES.</p>

<p>The coast tribes of Del Norte County, California, live
in constant terror of a malignant spirit that takes the
form of certain animals, the form of a bat, of a hawk, of
a tarantula, and so on&mdash;but especially delights in and
affects that of a screech-owl. The belief of the Russian-River
tribes and others is practically identical with this.</p>

<p>The Cahrocs have, as we already know, some conception
of a great deity, called Chareya, the Old Man Above;
he is wont to appear upon earth at times to some of the
most favored sorcerers; he is described as wearing
a close tunic, with a medicine-bag, and as having long
white hair that falls venerably about his shoulders.
Practically, however, the Cahrocs, like the majority of
Californian tribes, venerate chiefly the coyote. Great
dread is also had of certain forest-demons of nocturnal
habits; these, say the Eurocs, take the form of bears and
shoot arrows at benighted wayfarers.<a id="FNanchor_V-19" href="#Footnote_V-19" class="fnanchor">[V-19]</a></p>

<p>Between the foregoing outlines of Californian belief
and those connected with the remaining tribes, passing
south, we can detect no salient difference till we reach
the Olchones, a coast tribe between San Francisco and
Monterey; the sun here begins to be connected, or identified
by name, with that great spirit, or rather, that Big
Man, who made the earth and who rules in the sky.<a id="FNanchor_V-20" href="#Footnote_V-20" class="fnanchor">[V-20]</a>
So we find it again both around Monterey and around
San Luis Obispo; the first fruits of the earth were offered
in these neighborhoods to the great light, and his rising
was greeted with cries of joy.<a id="FNanchor_V-21" href="#Footnote_V-21" class="fnanchor">[V-21]</a></p>

<p>Father Gerónimo Boscana<a id="FNanchor_V-22" href="#Footnote_V-22" class="fnanchor">[V-22]</a> gives us the following
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">162</a></span>
relation of the faith and worship of the Acagchemem
nations, in the valley and neighborhood of San Juan
Capistrano, California. Part of it would fall naturally
into that part of this work alloted to origin; but the
whole is so intimately mixed with so much concerning
the life, deeds, and worship of various supernatural personages
that it has seemed better to fit its present position
than any other. Of the first part of the tradition there
are two versions&mdash;if indeed they be versions of the same
tradition. We give first that version held by the <i>serranos</i>,
or highlanders, of the interior country, three or four
leagues inland from the said San Juan Capistrano:&mdash;</p>

<p>Before the material world at all existed there lived two
beings, brother and sister, of a nature that can not be
explained; the brother living above, and his name
meaning the Heavens, the sister living below and her
name signifying Earth. From the union of these two,
there sprang a numerous offspring. Earth and sand
were the first fruits of this marriage; then were born
rocks and stones; then trees both great and small; then
grass and herbs; then animals; lastly was born a great
personage called Ouiot, who was a "grand captain." By
some unknown mother many children of a medicine race
were born to this Ouiot. All these things happened
in the north; and afterward when men were created
they were created in the north; but as the people multiplied
they moved toward the south, the earth growing
larger also and extending itself in the same direction.</p>

<p class="sidenote">THE COYOTE OF THE ACAGCHEMEMS.</p>

<p>In process of time, Ouiot becoming old, his children
plotted to kill him, alleging that the infirmities of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">163</a></span>
age made him unfit any longer to govern them or attend
to their welfare. So they put a strong poison in his
drink, and when he drank of it a sore sickness came
upon him; he rose up and left his home in the
mountains and went down to what is now the sea-shore,
though at that time there was no sea there. His mother,
whose name is the Earth, mixed him an antidote in a
large shell, and set the potion out in the sun to brew;
but the fragrance of it attracted the attention of the
Coyote, who came and overset the shell. So Ouiot sickened
to death, and though he told his children that he
would shortly return and be with them again, he has
never been seen since. All the people made a great
pile of wood and burnt his body there, and just as the
ceremony began the Coyote leaped upon the body, saying
that he would burn with it; but he only tore a piece of
flesh from the stomach and ate it and escaped. After
that the title of the Coyote was changed from Eyacque,
which means Sub-captain, to Eno, that is to say, Thief
and Cannibal.</p>

<p>When now the funeral rites were over, a general council
was held and arrangements made for collecting animal
and vegetable food; for up to this time the children
and descendants of Ouiot had nothing to eat but a kind
of white clay. And while they consulted together, behold
a marvelous thing appeared before them, and they
spoke to it saying: Art thou our captain, Ouiot. But the
spectre said: Nay, for I am greater than Ouiot; my
habitation is above, and my name is Chinigchinich.
Then he spoke further, having been told for what they
were come together: I create all things, and I go now to
make man, another people like unto you; as for you I
give you power, each after his kind, to produce all good
and pleasant things. One of you shall bring rain, and
another dew, and another make the acorn grow, and
others other seeds, and yet others shall cause all kinds of
game to abound in the land; and your children shall
have this power for ever, and they shall be sorcerers to
the men I go to create, and shall receive gifts of them,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">164</a></span>
that the game fail not and the harvests be sure. Then
Chinigchinich made man; out of the clay of the lake he
formed him, male and female; and the present Californians
are the descendants of the one or more pairs there
and thus created.</p>

<p>So ends the known tradition of the mountaineers;
we must now go back and take up the story anew at its
beginning, as told by the <i>playanos</i>, or people of the valley
of San Juan Capistrano. These say that an invisible
all-powerful being, called Nocuma, made the world and
all that it contains of things that grow and move. He
made it round like a ball and held it in his hands, where
it rolled about a good deal at first, till he steadied it by
sticking a heavy black rock called <i>tosaut</i> into it, as a kind
of ballast. The sea was at this time only a little stream
running round the world, and so crowded with fish that
their twinkling fins had no longer room to move; so
great was the press that some of the more foolish fry
were for effecting a landing and founding a colony,
upon the dry land, and it was only with the utmost
difficulty that they were persuaded by their elders, that
the killing air and baneful sun and the want of feet must
infallibly prove the destruction before many days of all
who took part in such a desperate enterprise. The proper
plan was evidently to improve and enlarge their present
home; and to this end, principally by the aid of one very
large fish, they broke the great rock tosaut in two, finding
a bladder in the centre filled with a very bitter substance.
The taste of it pleased the fish, so they emptied
it into the water, and instantly the water became salt
and swelled up and overflowed a great part of the old
earth, and made itself the new boundaries that remain
to this day.</p>

<p>Then Nocuma created a man, shaping him out of the
soil of the earth, calling him Ejoni. A woman also the
great god made, presumably of the same material as the
man, calling her Aé. Many children were born to this
first pair, and their descendants multiplied over the land.
The name of one of these last was Sirout, that is to say,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">165</a></span>
Handful of Tobacco, and the name of his wife was Ycaiut,
which means Above; and to Sirout and Ycaiut was
born a son, while they lived in a place north-east about
eight leagues from San Juan Capistrano. The name of
this son was Ouiot, that is to say Dominator; he grew a
fierce and redoubtable warrior; haughty, ambitious, tyrannous,
he extended his lordship on every side, ruling
everywhere as with a rod of iron; and the people conspired
against him. It was determined that he should
die by poison; a piece of the rock tosaut was ground up
in so deadly a way that its mere external application
was sufficient to cause death. Ouiot, notwithstanding
that he held himself constantly on the alert, having been
warned of his danger by a small burrowing animal called
the <i>cucumel</i>, was unable to avoid his fate; a few grains
of the cankerous mixture were dropped upon his breast
while he slept, and the strong mineral ate its way to the
very springs of his life. All the wise men of the land
were called to his assistance; but there was nothing for
him save to die. His body was burned on a great pile
with songs of joy and dances, and the nation rejoiced.</p>

<p class="sidenote">THE FIRST MEDICINE-MAN.</p>

<p>While the people were gathered to this end, it was
thought advisable to consult on the feasibility of procuring
seed and flesh to eat instead of the clay which
had up to this time been the sole food of the human
family. And while they yet talked together, there appeared
to them, coming they knew not whence, one
called Attajen, "which name implies man, or rational
being." And Attajen, understanding their desires, chose
out certain of the elders among them, and to these gave
he power; one that he might cause rain to fall, to another
that he might cause game to abound, and so with
the rest, to each his power and gift, and to the successors
of each for ever. These were the first medicine-men.</p>

<p>Many years having elapsed since the death of Ouiot,
there appeared in the same place one called Ouiamot,
reputed son of Tacu and Auzar&mdash;people unknown, but
natives; it is thought by Boscana, of "some distant land."
This Ouiamot is better known by his great name Chinigchinich,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">166</a></span>
which means Almighty. He first manifested
his powers to the people on a day when they had met in
congregation for some purpose or other; he appeared
dancing before them crowned with a kind of high
crown made of tall feathers stuck into a circlet of some
kind, girt with a kind of petticoat of feathers, and having
his flesh painted black and red. Thus decorated he was
called the <i>tobet</i>. Having danced some time, Chinigchinich
called out the medicine-men, or <i>puplems</i> as they were
called, among whom it would appear the chiefs are
always numbered, and confirmed their power; telling
them that he had come from the stars to instruct them
in dancing and all other things, and commanding that
in all their necessities they should array themselves in
the tobet, and so dance as he had danced, supplicating
him by his great name, that thus they might receive
of their petitions. He taught them how to worship
him, how to build <i>vanquechs</i>, or places of worship, and
how to direct their conduct in various affairs of life.
Then he prepared to die, and the people asked him if
they should bury him; but he warned them against
attempting such a thing: If ye buried me, he said, ye
would tread upon my grave, and for that my hand would
be heavy upon you; look to it, and to all your ways,
for lo, I go up where the high stars are, where mine eyes
shall see all the ways of men; and whosoever will not
keep my commandments nor observe the things I have
taught, behold disease shall plague all his body, and no
food shall come near his lips, the bear shall rend his
flesh, and the crooked tooth of the serpent shall sting
him.</p>

<p class="sidenote">SANCTUARIES OF REFUGE.</p>

<p>The vanquech, or place of worship, seems to have been
an unroofed inclosure of stakes, within which, on a
hurdle, was placed the image of the god Chinigchinich.
This image was the skin of a coyote or that of a mountain-cat
stuffed with the feathers of certain birds, and
with various other things, so that it looked like a live
animal; a bow and some arrows were attached to it on the
outside, and other arrows were thrust down its throat so
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">167</a></span>
that the feathers of them appeared at the mouth as out
of a quiver. The whole place of the inclosure was
sacred, and not to be approached without reverence; it
does not seem that sacrifices formed any part of the worship
there offered, but only prayer, and sometimes a kind
of pantomime connected with the undertaking desired to
be furthered&mdash;thus, desiring success in hunting one
mimicked the actions of the chase, leaping and twanging
one's bow. Each vanquech was a city of refuge, with
rights of sanctuary exceeding any ever granted in Jewish
or Christian countries. Not only was every criminal
safe there whatever his crime, but the crime was as it
were blotted out from that moment, and the offender was
at liberty to leave the sanctuary and walk about as
before; it was not lawful even to mention his crime; all
that the avenger could do was to point at him and deride
him, saying: Lo, a coward, who has been forced to flee to
Chinigchinich! This flight was rendered so much a
meaner thing in that it only turned the punishment from
the head of him that fled upon that of some of his relatives;
life went for life, eye for eye, and tooth for tooth,
even to the third and fourth generation, for justice' sake.</p>

<p>Besides Chinigchinich they worshiped, or at any rate
feared, a god called Touch; who inhabited the mountains
and the bowels of the earth, appearing, however,
from time to time in the form of various animals of a
terrifying kind. Every child at the age of six or seven
received, sent to him from this god, some animal as a
protector. To find out what this animal or spirit in the
shape of animal was, narcotic drinks were swallowed, or
the subject fasted and watched in the vanquech for a
given time, generally three days. He whose rank
entitled him to wait for his guardian apparition in the
sacred inclosure, was set there by the side of the god's
image, and on the ground before him was sketched by
one of the wise men an uncouth figure of some animal.
The child was then left to complete his vigil, being
warned at the same time to endure its hardships with
patience, in that any attempt to infringe upon its rules,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">168</a></span>
by eating or drinking or otherwise, would be reported to
the god by the sprawling figure the enchanter had drawn
in the clay, and that in such a case the punishment of
Chinigchinich would be terrible. After all this was
over, a scar was made on the child's right arm, and sometimes
on the thick part of the leg also, by covering the
part, "according to the figure required," with a peculiar
herb dried and powdered, and setting fire to it. This
was a brand or seal required by Chinigchinich, and was
besides supposed to strengthen the nerves and give "a
better pulse for the management of the bow."<a id="FNanchor_V-23" href="#Footnote_V-23" class="fnanchor">[V-23]</a></p>

<p>The Acagchemems, like many other Californian tribes,<a id="FNanchor_V-24" href="#Footnote_V-24" class="fnanchor">[V-24]</a>
regard the great buzzard with sentiments of veneration,
while they seem to have had connected with it several
rites and ideas peculiar to themselves. They called this
bird the <i>panes</i>, and once every year they had a festival of
the same name, in which the principal ceremony was the
killing of a buzzard without losing a drop of its blood.
It was next skinned, all possible care being taken to preserve
the feathers entire, as these were used in making
the feathered petticoat and diadem, already described as
part of the tobet. Last of all the body was buried within
the sacred inclosure amid great apparent grief from the
old women, they mourning as over the loss of relative
or friend. Tradition explained this: the panes
had indeed been once a woman, whom, wandering in the
mountain ways, the great god Chinigchinich had come
suddenly upon and changed into a bird. How this was
connected with the killing of her anew every year by
the people, and with certain extraordinary ideas held
relative to that killing is, however, by no means clear;
for it was believed that as often as the bird was killed it
was made alive again, and more, and faith to move
mountains&mdash;that the birds killed in one same yearly feast
in many separate villages were one and the same bird.
How these things were or why, none knew, it was enough
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">169</a></span>
that they were a commandment and ordinance of Chinigchinich,
whose ways were not as the ways of men.<a id="FNanchor_V-25" href="#Footnote_V-25" class="fnanchor">[V-25]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">AND THERE WAS WAR IN HEAVEN.</p>

<p class="p2">The Pericues of Lower California were divided into
two sects, worshiping two hostile divinities who made
a war of extermination upon each other. The tradition
explains that there was a great lord in heaven, called
Niparaya, who made earth and sea, and was almighty
and invisible. His wife was Anayicoyondi, a goddess
who, though possessing no body, bore him in a divinely
mysterious manner three children; one of whom, Quaayayp,
was a real man and born on earth, on the Acaragui
mountains. Very powerful this young god was, and a
long time he lived with the ancestors of the Pericues,
whom it is almost to be inferred that he created; at any rate
we are told that he was able to make men, drawing them
up out of the earth. The men at last killed this their
great hero and teacher, and put a crown of thorns upon
his head.<a id="FNanchor_V-26" href="#Footnote_V-26" class="fnanchor">[V-26]</a> Somewhere or other he remains lying dead
to this day, and he remains constantly beautiful, neither
does his body know corruption. Blood drips constantly
from his wounds, and he can speak no more, being dead;
yet there is an owl that speaks to him. And besides the
before-spoken-of god Niparaya in heaven, there was
another and hostile god called Wac or Tuparan. According
to the Niparaya sect, this Wac had made war on their
favorite god, and been by him defeated and cast forth of
heaven into a cave under the earth, of which cave the
whales of the sea were the guardians. With a perverse,
though not unnatural obstinacy, the sect that held Wac or
Tuparan to be their great god persisted in holding ideas
peculiar to themselves with regard to the truth of the
foregoing story; and their account of the great war in
heaven and its results differed from the other, as differ the
creeds of heterodox and orthodox everywhere; they ascribe,
for example, part of the creation to other gods besides
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">170</a></span>
Niparaya.<a id="FNanchor_V-27" href="#Footnote_V-27" class="fnanchor">[V-27]</a> The Cochimis and remaining natives of the
Californian peninsula seem to have held in the main
much the same ideas with regard to the gods and powers
above them as the Pericues held, and the sorcerers of all
had the common blowings, leapings, fastings, and other
mummeries that make these professors of the sinister art
so much alike everywhere in our territory.<a id="FNanchor_V-28" href="#Footnote_V-28" class="fnanchor">[V-28]</a></p>

<p class="p2">The natives of Nevada have ideas respecting a great
kind Spirit of some kind, as well as a myth concerning
an evil one; but they have no special class set apart as
medicine-men.<a id="FNanchor_V-29" href="#Footnote_V-29" class="fnanchor">[V-29]</a> The Utah belief seems to be as nearly
as possible identical with that of Nevada.<a id="FNanchor_V-30" href="#Footnote_V-30" class="fnanchor">[V-30]</a></p>

<p>The Comanches acknowledge more or less vaguely a
Supreme Spirit, but seem to use the Sun and the Earth
as mediators with and, in some sort, as embodiments of
him. They have a recognized body of sorcerers called
<i>puyacantes</i>, and various religious ceremonies and chants;
for the most part of a simple kind, and directed to the Sun
as the great source of life, and to the Earth as the producer
and receptacle of all that sustains life. According
to the Abbé Domenech, every Comanche wears a little
figure of the sun attached to his neck, or has a picture of
it painted on his shield; from the ears of each hang also
two crescents, which may possibly represent the moon.<a id="FNanchor_V-31" href="#Footnote_V-31" class="fnanchor">[V-31]</a></p>

<p>The Apaches recognize a supreme power in heaven
under the name Yaxtaxitaxitanne, the creator and master
of all things; but they render him no open service nor worship.
To any taciturn cunning man they are accustomed
to credit intercourse with a preternatural power of some
kind, and to look to him as a sort of oracle in various
emergencies. This is, in fact, their medicine-man, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">171</a></span>
in cases of illness he pretends to perform cures by the
aid of herbs and ceremonies of various kinds.<a id="FNanchor_V-32" href="#Footnote_V-32" class="fnanchor">[V-32]</a></p>

<p>The Navajos, having the usual class of sorcerers, call
their good deity Whaillahay, and their evil one Chinday;
the principal use of their good god seems to be to protect
them from their evil one. In smoking they sometimes
puff their tobacco-smoke toward heaven with great formality;
this is said to bring rain; to the same end certain
long round stones, thought to be cast down by the
clouds in a thunderstorm, are used with various ceremonies.</p>

<p>The sun, moon, and stars are thought to be powers
connected with rain and fine weather; while the god Montezuma
of their Pueblo neighbors is unknown among
them.<a id="FNanchor_V-33" href="#Footnote_V-33" class="fnanchor">[V-33]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">MONTEZUMA OF THE PUEBLOS.</p>

<p class="p2">All the Pueblo cities, though speaking different languages
hold substantially the same faith. They seem to
assent to the statement of the existence of a great and
good spirit whose name is too sacred to be mentioned;
but most say that Montezuma is his equal; and some,
again, that the Sun is the same as or equal to Montezuma.
There are, besides, the lesser divinities of water&mdash;Montezuma
being considered in one aspect as the great rain-god,
and as such often mentioned as being aided by or
being in connection with a serpent. Over and above
all these, the existence of a general class or body of evil
spirits is taken for granted.</p>

<p>Many places in New Mexico claim to be the birthplace
of the great leader, teacher, and god Montezuma. At
any rate he is traditionally supposed to have appeared
among the Pueblos before they had arrived at or built
their present towns. Some traditions would make him
either the ancestor or the creator of the same people; but
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">172</a></span>
the most regard him as a kind of semi or wholly divine
priest, prophet, leader, and legislator. Under restrictions
pointed out in a former note,<a id="FNanchor_V-34" href="#Footnote_V-34" class="fnanchor">[V-34]</a> we may fairly regard
him as at once the Melchizedek, the Moses, and the
Messiah of these Pueblo desert wanderers from an Egypt
that history is ignorant of, and whose name even tradition
whispers not. He taught his people to build cities
with tall houses, to construct estufas, or semi-sacred
sweat-houses, and to kindle and guard the sacred fire.</p>

<p>At Acoma, it is said by some, was established the first
Pueblo, and thence the people marched southward, forming
others. Acoma was one, and Pecos another. At
this last, Montezuma planted a tree upside down, and
said that, on his leaving them, a strange nation should
oppress them for many years, years also in which there
should be no rain, but that they were to persist in
watching the sacred fire until the tree fell, when he
would return, with a white race which should destroy
their enemies; and then rain should fall again and the
earth be fertile. It is said that this tree fell from its
abnormal position, as the American army entered Santa
Fé.</p>

<p class="sidenote">HE IS NOT DEAD BUT SLEEPETH.</p>

<p>The watching of the fire, kept up in subterranean
estufas, under a covering of ashes generally, and in the
basin of a small altar, was no light task. The warriors
took the post by turns, some said, for two successive days
and nights, sans food, sans drink, sans sleep, sans everything.
Others affirm that this watching was kept up
till exhaustion and even death relieved the guard&mdash;the
last not to be wondered at, seeing the insufferable closeness
of the place and the accumulation of carbonic acid.
The remains of the dead were, it was sometimes supposed,
carried off by a monstrous serpent. This holy fire was
believed to be the palladium of the city, and the watchers
by it could well dream of that day, when, coming
with the sun, Montezuma should descend by the column
of smoke whose roots they fed, and should fill the shabby
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">173</a></span>
little estufa with a glory like that in a wilderness tabernacle
they knew not of, where a more awful pillar of
smoke shadowed the mystic cherubim. Hope dies hard,
and the dim memories of a great past never quite fade
away from among any people. No true-born British
bard ever doubted of Arthur's return from his kingly
rest in Avalon, nor that the flash of Excalibar should be
one day again as the lightning of death in the eyes of
the hated Saxon. The herders on the shore of Lucerne
know that were Switzerland in peril, the Tell would
spring from his sleep as at the crack of doom. "When
Germany is at her lowest then is her greatness nearest"
say the weird old ballads of that land; for then shall the
Great Kaiser rise from the vault in the Kyffhäuser&mdash;Barbarossa
shall rise, though his beard be grown through the
long stone table. Neither is the Frank without his
savior: Sing, O troubadours, sing and strike the chords
proudly! Who shall prevail while Charlemagne but
sleeps in the shadow of the Untersberg?&mdash;And so our
Pueblo sentinel climbing the housetop at Pecos, looking
ever eastward from Santo Domingo on the Rio Grande;
he too waits for the beautiful feet upon the mountains
and the plumes of him&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>Who dwelt up in the yellow sun,</p>
<p>And sorrowing for man's despair,</p>
<p>Slid by his trailing yellow hair</p>

<p>The blessedness of peace.<a id="FNanchor_V-35" href="#Footnote_V-35" class="fnanchor">[V-35]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p>The Pueblo chiefs seem to be at the same time priests;
they perform the various simple rites by which the power
of the sun and of Montezuma is recognized as well as
the power&mdash;according to some accounts&mdash;of "the Great
Snake, to whom by order of Montezuma they are to look
for life;" they also officiate in certain ceremonies with
which they pray for rain. There are painted representations
of the Great Snake, together with that of a misshapen
red-haired man declared to stand for Montezuma.
Of this last there was also in 1845, in the pueblo of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">174</a></span>
Laguna, a rude effigy or idol, intended, apparently, to
represent only the head of the deity; it was made of
tanned skin in the form of a brimless hat or cylinder
open at the bottom. Half-way round, it was painted
red; the other half was green. The green side was
rudely marked to suggest a face: two triangles were cut
for eyes; there was no nose; a circular leather patch
served for a mouth, and two other patches in an
appropriate situation suggested ears. Crowning the
head was a small tuft of leather, said to be supplemented
by feathers on festal occasions. A sorry image one
would say, yet one looked upon by its exhibitors with
apparently the greatest veneration; they kneeling in a
most devoted manner, going through a form of prayer,
and sprinkling it with a white powder. One of the
worshipers said it was God and the brother of God;
and the people bring it out in dry seasons, and, with
dancing and other rites, invoke it for rain.</p>

<p>Christianity has now effaced the memory of most of
the rites of the Pueblo religion, but Dr Ten Broeck
noticed that many of the worshipers at the Christian
church in Laguna carried little baskets in their hands
containing images of domestic animals, or of beasts of the
chase, molded in mud or dough; it being the custom, as
it had been there from time immemorial, for those that
had been successful in the chase, or in accumulating
cattle, to bring such simulachres of their prosperity before
the altar of God&mdash;probably, a modification produced by
the poverty of the people of a rite as old as the altar of
Abel, to wit, the offering of the firstlings and first-fruits to
that Deity whose blessing had given the increase.</p>

<p>It has been affirmed, without much foundation or probability
of truth, that the Pueblos worshiped fire and
water.<a id="FNanchor_V-36" href="#Footnote_V-36" class="fnanchor">[V-36]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">175</a></span></p>

<p>The Moquis know nothing of Montezuma; they believe
in a Great Father, living where the sun rises, and in a
great Mother, whose home is where the sun goes down.
This Father is the father of evil, war, pestilence, and
famine; but from the mother are all their joy, peace,
plenty, and health.<a id="FNanchor_V-37" href="#Footnote_V-37" class="fnanchor">[V-37]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">MOJAVE DEITIES.</p>

<p>The Mojaves tell of a certain Matevil, creator of heaven
and earth, who was wont in time past to remain
among them in a certain grand <i>casa</i>. This habitation
was, however, by some untoward event broken down;
the nations were destroyed; and Matevil departed eastward.
Whence, in the latter days, he will again return
to consolidate, prosper, and live with his people forever.
This Matevil, or Mathowelia, has a son called Mastamho,
who made the water and planted trees. There is also
an Evil Spirit Newathie.<a id="FNanchor_V-38" href="#Footnote_V-38" class="fnanchor">[V-38]</a></p>

<p class="p2">From a letter just received from Judge Roseborough,
I am enabled to close this chapter with some new and
valuable facts regarding the religious ideas of certain
tribes&mdash;not accurately specified&mdash;of the north-west portion
of Upper California. The learned judge has given
unusual attention to the subject of which he writes, and his
opportunities for procuring information must have been
frequent during ten years of travel and residence in the
districts of the northern counties of California:&mdash;</p>

<p>Among the tribes in the neighborhood of Trinity river
is found a legend relating to a certain Wappeckquemow,
who was a giant, and apparently the father and leader of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">176</a></span>
a pre-human race like himself. He was expelled from the
country that he inhabited&mdash;near the mouth of the Klamath&mdash;for
disobeying or offending some great god, and a
curse was pronounced against him, so that not even his
descendants should ever return to that land. On the
expulsion of these Anakim, the ancestors of the people to
whom this legend belongs came down from the north-west,
a direction of migration, according to Judge Roseborough,
uniformly adhered to in the legends of all the
tribes of north-west California. These new settlers, however,
like their predecessors of the giant race, quarreled
with the great god and were abandoned by him to their
own devices, being given over into the hands of certain
evil powers or devils. Of these the first is Omahá, who,
possessing the shape of a grizzly bear, is invisible and
goes about everywhere bringing sickness and misfortune
on mankind. Next there is Makalay, a fiend with a horn
like a unicorn; he is swift as the wind and moves by
great leaps like a kangaroo. The sight of him is usually
death to mortals. There is, thirdly, a dreadful being
called Kalicknateck, who seems a faithful reproduction of
the great thunder-bird of the north: thus Kalicknateck
"is a huge bird that sits on the mountain-peak, and broods
in silence over his thoughts until hungry; when he will
sweep down over the ocean, snatch up a large whale, and
carry it to his mountain-throne, for a single meal."</p>

<p>Besides the before-mentioned powers of evil, these
Trinity people have legends connected with other personages
of the same nature, among whom are Wanuswegock,
Surgelp, Napousney, and Nequiteh.</p>

<p>When white miners first came to work on the Trinity
River, their advent caused, as may be imagined, much
unsatisfactory speculation among the aborigines; some
saying one thing of the whites and some another. At
last an old seer of the Hoopah Valley settled the question
by declaring that the new-comers were descendants of
that banished Wappeckquemow, from whose heads the
already-mentioned curse, forbidding their return, had
been by some means lifted.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">177</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE KITCHEN-MIDDEN OF THE HOHGATES.</p>

<p>The coast people in northern California have
a story about a mysterious people called Hohgates,
to whom is ascribed an immense bed of mussel-shells
and bones of animals still existing on the
table-land of Point St George, near Crescent City.
These Hohgates, seven in number, are said to have
come to the place in a boat, to have built themselves
"houses above-ground, after the style of white men"&mdash;all
this about the time that the first natives came
down the coast from the north. These Hohgates, living
at the point mentioned, killed many elk on land, and
many seals and sea-lions in fishing excursions from their
boats; using for the latter purpose a kind of harpoon
made of a knife attached to a stick, and the whole fastened
to the boat with a long line. They also sailed frequently
to certain rocks, and loaded their little vessels with mussels.
By all this they secured plenty of food, and the
refuse of it, the bones and shells and so on, rapidly
accumulated into the great <i>kjökken mödding</i> still to be
seen. One day, however, all the Hohgates being out at
sea in their boat, they struck a huge sea-lion with their
rude harpoon, and, unable or unwilling to cut or throw
off their line, were dragged with fearful speed toward a
great whirlpool, called Chareckquin, that lay far toward
the north-west. It is the place where souls go, where
in darkness and cold the spirits shiver for ever; living
men suffer even from its winds&mdash;from the north-west
wind, the bleak and bitter Charreck-rawek. And just
as the boat reached the edge of this fearful place, behold,
a marvelous thing: the rope broke and the sea-monster
was swept down alone into the whirl of wind and water,
while the Hohgates were caught up into the air; swinging
round and round, their boat floated steadily up into the
vast of heaven. Nevermore on earth were the Hohgates
seen; but there are seven stars in heaven that all men
know of, and these stars are the seven Hohgates that
once lived where the great shell-bed near Crescent City
now is.

</p>

<p>From the Pueblo cities let us now pass down into
Mexico, glancing first at the northern and north-western
neighbors of this great people that ruled on the plateau
of Anáhuac. The Chihuahuans worshiped a great god
called by them the 'captain of heaven' and recognized
a lesser divinity as abiding in and inspiring their priests
and medicine-men. They rendered homage to the sun;
and when any comet or other phenomenon appeared in
the heavens they offered sacrifice thereto; their sacrifice
being much after the Mexican fashion&mdash;fruits, herbs, and
such things as they had, together with blood drawn from
their bodies by the pricks of a thorn.<a id="FNanchor_VI-1" href="#Footnote_VI-1" class="fnanchor">[VI-1]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">GODS OF SONORA AND DURANGO.</p>

<p>In Sonora&mdash;the great central heart of Mexico making
its beatings more and more clearly felt as we approach
it nearer&mdash;the vague feelings of awe and reverence with
which the savage regards the unseen, unknown, and unknowable
powers, begin at last to somewhat lose their
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">179</a></span>
vagueness and to crystallize into the recognition of a
power to be represented and symbolized by a god made
with hands. The offerings thereto begin also, more and
more, to lose their primitive simple shape, and the blood,
without which is no remission of sins, stains the rude
altar that a more Arcadian race had only heaped with
flowers and fruit. The natives of Sonora bring, says Las
Casas, "many deer, wolves, hares, and birds before a
large idol, with music of many flutes and other instruments
of theirs; then cutting open the animals through
the middle, they take out their hearts and hang them
round the neck of the image, wetting it with the flowing
blood. It is certain that the only offering made in all
this province of Sonora was the hearts of brutes."<a id="FNanchor_VI-2" href="#Footnote_VI-2" class="fnanchor">[VI-2]</a> All
this they did more especially in two great festivals they
had, the one at seed-time, the other at harvest; and we have
reason to rejoice that the thing was no worse, reason to
be glad that the hearts of brave men and fair women, and
soft children not knowing their right hand from their left,
were not called for, as in the land of the eagle and cactus
banner, to feed that devil's Minotaur, superstition.</p>

<p>The people of Durango called the principal power in
which they believed Meyuncame, that is to say, Maker
of All Things; they had another god, Cachiripa, whose
name is all we know of him. They had besides innumerable
private idols, penates of all possible and impossible
figures; some being stone, shaped by nature only.
In one village they worshiped a great flint knife that
their flint implements of every kind might be good and
sure. They had gods of storm and gods of sunshine,
gods of good and gods of evil, gods of everything in
heaven above or in the earth beneath or in the waters
under the earth. Their idols received bloody sacrifices,
not always of beasts; a bowl containing beans and the
cooked human flesh of an enemy was offered to them
for success in war.<a id="FNanchor_VI-3" href="#Footnote_VI-3" class="fnanchor">[VI-3]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">180</a></span></p>

<p>Much of the preceding paragraph belongs also to Sinaloa
or cannot be exactly located more in the one province
than in the other. The Sinaloas are said to have
venerated above all the other gods one called Cocohuame,
which is, being interpreted, Death. They worshiped also
a certain Ouraba,<a id="FNanchor_VI-4" href="#Footnote_VI-4" class="fnanchor">[VI-4]</a> which is Valor, offering him bows,
arrows, and all kinds of instruments of war. To Sehuatoba,
that is to say Pleasure, they sacrificed feathers,
raiment, beads of glass, and women's ornaments. Bamusehua
was the god of water. In some parts, it is said,
there was recognized a divine element in common herbs
and birds. One deity&mdash;or devil, as Ribas calls him with
the exquisite courtesy that distinguishes the theosophic
historian&mdash;was the especial patron of a class of wizards
closely resembling the shamáns and medicine-men of
the north. No one seemed to know exactly the powers
of this deity, but everyone admitted their extent by recognizing
with a respectful awe their effects; effects
brought about through the agency of the wizards,
by the use of bags, rattles, magic stones, blowings, suckings,
and all that routine of sorcery with which we are
already familiar. This deity was called Grandfather or
Ancestor.<a id="FNanchor_VI-5" href="#Footnote_VI-5" class="fnanchor">[VI-5]</a></p>

<p>One Sinaloa nation, the Tahus, in the neighborhood
of Culiacan, reared great serpents for which they had
a good deal of veneration. They propitiated their gods
with offerings of precious stones and rich stuffs, but they
did not sacrifice men. With an altogether characteristic
insinuation, the Abbé Domenech says, that though
highly immoral in the main, they so highly respected
women who devoted themselves to a life of celibacy,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">181</a></span>
that they held great festivals in their honor&mdash;leaving
the reader to suppose that the Tahus had a class
of female religious who devoted themselves to a life of
chastity and were respected for that reason; the truth is
found to be, on referring to the author Castañeda&mdash;from
whom apparently the abbé has taken this half truth
and whole falsehood&mdash;that these estimable celibate women
were the public prostitutes of the nation.<a id="FNanchor_VI-6" href="#Footnote_VI-6" class="fnanchor">[VI-6]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">THE MEXICAN RELIGION AND ITS HISTORIANS.</p>

<p class="p2">The Mexican religion, as transmitted to us, is a confused
and clashing chaos of fragments. If ever the great
nation of Anáhuac had its Hesiod or its Homer, no ray
of his light has reached the stumbling feet of research in
that direction; no echo of his harmony has been ever
heard by any ear less dull than that of a Zumárraga. It
is given to few men to rise above their age, and it is
folly to expect grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles; yet it
is hard to suppress wholly some feelings of regret, in
poring upon those ponderous tomes of sixteenth and
seventeenth century history that touch upon Mexican
religion; one pities far less the inevitable superstition
and childish ignorance of the barbarian than the senility
of his Christian historian and critic&mdash;there was some
element of hope and evidence of attainment in what the
half-civilized barbarian knew; but from what heights of
Athenian, Roman, and Alexandrian philosophy and eloquence,
had civilization fallen into the dull and arrogant
nescience of the chronicles of the clergy of Spain.</p>

<p>We have already noticed<a id="FNanchor_VI-7" href="#Footnote_VI-7" class="fnanchor">[VI-7]</a> the existence of at least two
schools of religious philosophy in Mexico, two average
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">182</a></span>
levels of thought, the one that of the vulgar and credulous,
the other that of the more enlightened and reflective.
It has resulted from this that different writers
differ somewhat in their opinions with regard to the precise
nature and essence of that religion, some saying one
thing and some another. I cannot show this more shortly
and&mdash;what is much more important in a subject like
this&mdash;more exactly, than by quoting a number of these
opinions:</p>

<p>"Turning from the simple faiths of savage tribes of
America, to the complex religion of the half-civilized
Mexican nation, we find what we might naturally expect,
a cumbrous polytheism complicated by mixture of several
national pantheons, and beside and beyond this, certain
appearances of a doctrine of divine supremacy. But
these doctrines seem to have been spoken of more definitely
than the evidence warrants. A remarkable native
development of Mexican theism must be admitted, in
so far as we may receive the native historian Ixtlilxochitl's
account of the worship paid by Nezahualcoyotl,
the poet-king of Tezcuco, to the invisible supreme Tloque-Nahuaque,
he who has all in him, the cause of causes,
in whose star-roofed pyramid stood an idol, and who
there received no bloody sacrifice, but only flowers and
incense. Yet it would have been more satisfactory, were
the stories told by this Aztec panegyrist of his royal ancestors
confirmed by other records. Traces of divine
supremacy in Mexican religion are especially associated
with Tezcatlipoca, 'Shining Mirror,' a deity who seems
in his original nature the Sun-god, and thence by expansion
to have become the soul of the world, creator of
heaven and earth, lord of all things, Supreme Deity.
Such conceptions may, in more or less measure, have
arisen in native thought, but it should be pointed out
that the remarkable Aztec religious formulas collected
by Sahagun, in which the deity Tezcatlipoca is so prominent
a figure, show traces of Christian admixture in their
material, as well as of Christian influence in their style.
In distinct and absolute personality, the divine Sun in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">183</a></span>
Aztec theology was Tonatiuh<a id="FNanchor_VI-8" href="#Footnote_VI-8" class="fnanchor">[VI-8]</a> whose huge pyramid-mound
stands on the plain of Teotihuacan, a witness of
his worship for future ages. Beyond this the religion of
Mexico, in its complex system, or congeries of great gods,
such as results from the mixture and alliance of the
deities of several nations, shows the solar element rooted
deeply and widely in other personages of its divine mythology,
and attributes especially to the sun the title of
Teotl, God."<a id="FNanchor_VI-9" href="#Footnote_VI-9" class="fnanchor">[VI-9]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">COMPLEXITY OF AZTEC THEOLOGY.</p>

<p>"It is remarkable," says Professor J. G. Müller, "that
the well-instructed Acosta should have known nothing
about the adoration of a highest invisible God, under
the name of Teotl. And yet this adoration has been reported
in the most certain manner by others, and made
evident from more exact statements regarding the nature
of this deity. He has been surnamed Ipalnemoan, that
is, He through whom we live, and Tloquenahuaque, that
is, He who is all things through himself. He has been
looked upon as the originator and essence of all things,
and as especially throned in the high cloud-surrounded
mountains. Rightly does Wuttke contend against any
conception of this deity as a monotheistic one, the polytheism
of the people being considered&mdash;for polytheism and
monotheism will not be yoked together; even if a logical
concordance were found, the inner spirits of the principles
of the two would still be opposed to each other.
Another argument stands also clearly out, in the total
absence of any prayers, offerings, feasts, or temples to or
in the honor of this god. From this it is evident that
Teotl was not a god of the common people. Yet this,
on the other hand, cannot justify us&mdash;the so-frequently-occurring
statements of well-informed authorities being
taken into account&mdash;in denying in toto all traces of a pantheistic
monotheism, as this latter may easily spring up
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">184</a></span>
among cultivated polytheists as a logical result and outcome
of their natural religion. Nezahualcoyotl, the enlightened
king of Tezcuco, adored as the cause of causes,
a god without an image. The chief of the Totonac
aborigines of Cempoallan had, if we may credit the
speech put in his mouth by Las Casas and Herrera, an
idea of a highest god and creator. This abstract
idea has also here, as in other parts of America, intertwined
itself with the conception of a sun-god. Hence
the Mexicans named the sun-god pre-eminently Teotl;
and that enlightened king of Tezcuco, who built a temple
of nine stories&mdash;symbolizing the nine heavens&mdash;in honor
of the stars, called the sun-god his father."<a id="FNanchor_VI-10" href="#Footnote_VI-10" class="fnanchor">[VI-10]</a></p>

<p>"To the most ancient gods," says Klemm, "belonged
the divinities of nature, as well as a highest being called
Teotl, God. He was perfect, independent, and invisible,
and consequently not represented by any image. His
qualities were represented by expressions like these:
He through whom we live, He who is all in himself.
This god coincides very nearly with the Master of
Life of the North Americans. In opposition to him
is the evil spirit, the enemy of mankind, who often
appears to and terrifies them. He is called Tlacatecololotl,
that is to say, Rational Owl, and may possibly,
like the Lame-foot of the Peruvians, be a survival
from the times when the old hunter-nations inhabited
the forests and mountains. Next to Teotl
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">185</a></span>
was Tezcatlipoca, that is to say, Shining Mirror; he
was the god of providence, the soul of the world,
and the creator of heaven and earth. Teotl was
not represented by any image, and was probably not
worshiped with offerings nor in any special temples;
Tezcatlipoca was, however, so represented, and that as
a youth, because time could have no power over his
beauty and his splendor. He rewarded the righteous,
and punished the ungodly with sickness and misfortune.
He created the world, and mankind, and the sun, and
the water, and he was himself in a certain degree the
overseer thereof."<a id="FNanchor_VI-11" href="#Footnote_VI-11" class="fnanchor">[VI-11]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">TLOQUE-NAHUAQUE.</p>

<p>The Abbé Brasseur believes in the knowledge by the
Mexicans and certain neighboring or related nations, of
a Supreme God; but he thinks also that the names of
great priests and legislators have often been used for or
confounded with the one Name above every name. He
says: "In the traditions that have reached us the
name of the legislator is often confused with that
of the divinity; and behind the symbolic veil that covers
primitive history, he who civilized and brought to light
in the Americans a new life, is designedly identified with
the Father of the universal creation. The writers who
treat of the history of the ancient American nations avow
that, at the time of the landing of the Spaniards on the
soil of the western continent, there was not one that did
not recognize the existence of a supreme deity and arbiter
of the universe. In that confusion of religious ideas,
which is the inevitable result of ignorance and superstition,
the notion of a unique immaterial being, of an invisible
power, had survived the shipwreck of pure primitive
creeds. Under the name Tloque-Nahuaque, the
Mexicans adored Him who is the first cause of all things,
who preserves and sustains all by his providence; calling
him again, for the same reason, Ipalnemoaloni, He
in whom and by whom we are and live. This god was
the same as that Kunab-Ku, the Alone Holy, who was
adored in Yucatan; the same again as that Hurakan,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">186</a></span>
the Voice that Cries, the Heart of Heaven, found with the
Guatemalan nations of Central America; and the same
lastly as that Teotl, God, whom we find named in the
Tzendal and Mexican books. This "God of all purity,"
as he was styled in a Mexican prayer, was, however, too
elevated for the thoughts of the vulgar. His existence
was recognized, and sages invoked him; but he had
neither temples nor altars&mdash;perhaps because no one
knew how he should be represented&mdash;and it was only
in the last times of the Aztec monarchy that Nezahualcoyotl,
king of Tezcuco, dedicated to him a teocalli of nine
terraces, without statues, under the title of the unknown
god."<a id="FNanchor_VI-12" href="#Footnote_VI-12" class="fnanchor">[VI-12]</a></p>

<p>Mr Gallatin says of the Mexicans: "Their mythology,
as far as we know it, presents a great number of unconnected
gods, without apparent system or unity of design.
It exhibits no evidence of metaphysical research or imaginative
powers. Viewed only as a development of the
intellectual faculties of man, it is, in every respect, vastly
inferior to the religious systems of Egypt, India, Greece,
or Scandinavia. If imported, it must have been from
some barbarous country, and brought directly from such
country to Mexico, since no traces of a similar worship
are found in the more northern parts of America."<a id="FNanchor_VI-13" href="#Footnote_VI-13" class="fnanchor">[VI-13]</a></p>

<p>"The Aztecs," writes Prescott, "recognized the existence
of a Supreme Creator and Lord of the Universe.
But the idea of unity&mdash;of a being, with whom volition
is action, who has no need of inferior ministers to
execute his purposes&mdash;was too simple, or too vast, for
their understandings; and they sought relief as usual,
in a plurality of deities, who presided over the elements,
the changes of the seasons, and the various occupations
of man. Of these, there were thirteen principal deities,
and more than two hundred inferior; to each of whom
some special day, or appropriate festival, was consecrated."<a id="FNanchor_VI-14" href="#Footnote_VI-14" class="fnanchor">[VI-14]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">187</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">PRIMITIVE WORSHIP.</p>

<p>According to Mr Squier: "The original deities of the
Mexican pantheon are few in number. Thus when the
Mexicans engaged in a war, in defense of the liberty or
sovereignty of their country, they invoked the War God,
under his aspect and name Huitzlipochtli. When suddenly
attacked by enemies, they called upon the same
god, under his aspect and name of Paynalton, which implied
God of Emergencies, etc. In fact, as already elsewhere
observed, all the divinities of the Mexican, as of
every other mythology, resolve themselves into the primeval
God and Goddess."<a id="FNanchor_VI-15" href="#Footnote_VI-15" class="fnanchor">[VI-15]</a></p>

<p>"The population of Central America," says the Vicomte
de Bussierre, "although they had preserved the
vague notion of a superior eternal God and creator,
known by the name Teotl, had an Olympus as numerous
as that of the Greeks and the Romans. It would appear&mdash;the
most ancient, though, unfortunately, also the most
obscure legends being followed&mdash;that during the civilized
period which preceded the successive invasions of the
barbarous hordes of the north, the inhabitants of Anáhuac
joined to the idea of a supreme being the worship
of the sun and the moon, offering them flowers, fruits,
and the first fruits of their fields. The most ancient
monuments of the country, such as the pyramids of Teotihuacan,
were incontestably consecrated to these luminaries.
Let us now trace some of the most striking
features of these people. Among the number of their
gods, is found one represented under the figure of a man
eternally young, and considered as the symbol of the
supreme and mysterious God. Two other gods there
were, watching over mortals from the height of a celestial
city, and charged with the accomplishment of their
prayers. Air, earth, fire, and water had their particular
divinities. The woman of the serpent, the prolific
woman, she who never gave birth but to twins, was
adored as the mother of the human race. The sun and
the moon had their altars. Various divinities presided
over the phenomena of nature, over the day, the night,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">188</a></span>
the mist, the thunder, the harvest, the mountains, and
so on. Souls, the place of the dead, warriors, hunters,
merchants, fishing, love, drunkenness, medicine, flowers,
and many other things had their special gods. A multitude
of heroes and of illustrious kings, whose apotheosis
had been decreed, took their place in this vast pantheon,
where were besides seated two hundred and sixty divinities
of inferior rank, to each of whom nevertheless one
of the days of the year was consecrated. Lastly, every
city, every family, every individual, had its or his celestial
protector, to whom worship was rendered. The
number of the temples corresponded to that of the gods;
these temples were found everywhere, in the cities, in
the fields, in the woods, along the roads, and all of them
had priests charged with their service. This complicated
mythology was common to all the nations of Anáhuac,
even to those that the empire had been unable to subjugate
and with which it was at war; but each country
had its favorite god, such god being to it, what Huitzilopochtli,
the god of war, was to the Aztecs."<a id="FNanchor_VI-16" href="#Footnote_VI-16" class="fnanchor">[VI-16]</a></p>

<p>The Mexican religion, as summed up by Mr Brantz Mayer,<a id="FNanchor_VI-17" href="#Footnote_VI-17" class="fnanchor">[VI-17]</a>
"was a compound of spiritualism and gross idolatry;
for the Aztecs believed in a Supreme Deity, whom they
called Teotl, God; or Ipalnemoani, He by whom we
live; or Tloque Nahuaque, He who has all in himself;
while their evil spirit bore the name of Tlaleatcololotl,
the Rational Owl. These spiritual beings are surrounded
by a number of lesser divinities, who were probably
the ministerial agents of Teotl. These were
Huitzilopochtli, the god of war, and Teoyaomiqui,
his spouse, whose duty it was to conduct the souls of
warriors who perished in defense of their homes and
religion to the 'house of the sun,' the Aztec heaven.
Huitzilopochtli, or Mextli, the god of war, was the
special protector of the Aztecs; and devoted as they
were to war, this deity was always invoked before battle,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">189</a></span>
and recompensed after it by the offering of numerous
captives taken in conflict."</p>

<p class="sidenote">MEXICAN RELIGION, GREEK AND ROMAN.</p>

<p>"The religion of the Mexicans," writes Señor Carbajal
Espinosa,<a id="FNanchor_VI-18" href="#Footnote_VI-18" class="fnanchor">[VI-18]</a> plagiarizing as literally as possible from Clavigero,
"was a tissue of errors and of cruel and superstitious
rites. Similar infirmities of the human mind are inseparable
from a religious system originating in caprice
and fear, as we see even in the most cultured nations
of antiquity. If the religion of the Mexicans be compared
with that of the Greeks and Romans, it will be
found that the latter is the more superstitious and ridiculous
and the former the more barbarous and sanguinary.
These celebrated nations of ancient Europe
multiplied excessively their gods because of the mean
idea that they had of their power; restricting their rule
within narrow limits, attributing to them the most atrocious
crimes, and solemnizing their worship with such
execrable impurities as were so justly condemned by the
fathers of Christianity. The gods of the Mexicans were
less imperfect, and their worship although superstitious
contained nothing repugnant to decency. They had
some idea, although imperfect, of a Supreme Being, absolute,
independent, believing that they owed him tribute,
adoration, and fear. They had no figure whereby
to represent him, believing him to be invisible, neither
did they give him any other name, save the generic one,
God, which is in the Mexican tongue teotl, resembling
even more in sense than in pronunciation the theos of
the Greeks; they used, however, epithets, in the highest
degree expressive, to signify the grandeur and the power
which they believed him endowed with, calling him
Ipalnemoani, that is to say, He by whom we live, and
Tloque-Nahuaque, which means, He that is all things in
himself. But the knowledge and the worship of this
Supreme Essence were obscured by the multitude of gods
invented by superstition. The people believed furthermore
in an evil spirit, inimical to mankind, calling
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">190</a></span>
him Tlacatecololotl, or Rational Owl, and saying that
oftentimes he revealed himself to men, to hurt or to
terrify them."</p>

<p>"The Mexicans and the Tezcucans," following Señor
Pimentel, "recognized the existence of a Supreme Being,
of a First Cause, and gave him that generic title Teotl,
God, the analogy of which with the Theos of the Greeks,
has been already noted by various authors. The idea of
God is one of those that appear radical to our very existence....
With the Mexicans and Tezcucans this idea
was darkened by the adoration of a thousand gods, invoked
in all emergencies; of these gods there were thirteen
principal, the most notable being the god of providence,
that of war, and that of the wind and waters.
The god of providence had his seat in the sky, and had
in his care all human affairs. The god of the waters
was considered as the fertilizer of earth, and his dwelling
was in the highest of the mountains where he arranged
the clouds. The god of war was the principal protector
of the Mexicans, their guide in their wanderings from
the mysterious country of Aztlan, the god to whose
favor they owed those great victories that elevated them
from the lowly estate of lake-fishermen up to the lordship
of Anáhuac. The god of the wind had an aspect
more benign.... The Mexicans also worshiped the sun
and the moon, and even, it would appear, certain animals
considered as sacred. There figured also in the
Aztec mythology an evil genius called the Owl-man,<a id="FNanchor_VI-19" href="#Footnote_VI-19" class="fnanchor">[VI-19]</a>
since in some manner the good and the bad, mixed up
here on earth, have to be explained. So the Persians
had their Oromasdes and Arimanes, the first the genius
of good, and the second of evil, and so, later, Manicheism
presents us with analogous explanations."<a id="FNanchor_VI-20" href="#Footnote_VI-20" class="fnanchor">[VI-20]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE NAMELESS GOD.</p>

<p>Solis, writing of Mexico and the Mexicans says:
"There was hardly a street without its tutelary god;
neither was there any calamity of nature without its altar,
to which they had recourse for remedy. They imagined
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">191</a></span>
and made their gods out of their own fear; not understanding
that they lessened the power of some by what
they attributed to others.... But for all so many as were
their gods, and so complete as was the blindness of their
idolatry, they were not without the knowledge of a
Superior Deity, to whom they attributed the creation of
the heavens and the earth. This original of things was,
among the Mexicans, a god without name; they had no
word in their language with which to express him, only
they gave it to be understood that they knew him, pointing
reverently towards heaven, and giving to him after their
fashion the attribute of ineffable, with that sort of religious
uncertainty with which the Athenians venerated the
Unknown God."<a id="FNanchor_VI-21" href="#Footnote_VI-21" class="fnanchor">[VI-21]</a></p>

<p>The interpreter of the Codex Telleriano-Remensis calls
the Supreme God of the Mexicans by the name Tonacateotle.<a id="FNanchor_VI-22" href="#Footnote_VI-22" class="fnanchor">[VI-22]</a>
The interpreter says: "God, Lord, Creator,
Governor of all, Tloque, Nauaq, Tlalticpaque, Teotlalale-Matlava-Tepeva&mdash;all
these epithets they bestowed on
their god Tonacateotle, who, they said, was the god that
created the world; and him alone they painted with a
crown as lord of all. They never offered sacrifices to
this god for they said he cared not for such things. All
the others to whom they sacrificed were men once on a
time, or demons."<a id="FNanchor_VI-23" href="#Footnote_VI-23" class="fnanchor">[VI-23]</a></p>

<p>We have already seen from Herrera that "the Mexicans
confessed to a Supreme God, Lord, and maker of
all things, and the said God was the principal that they
venerated, looking towards heaven, and calling him
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">192</a></span>
Creator of heaven and earth."<a id="FNanchor_VI-24" href="#Footnote_VI-24" class="fnanchor">[VI-24]</a> In contradistinction
to this it may be well to consider the following extract
from the same author: "Such was the blindness of the
Mexicans, even to the natural light, that they did not
think like men of good judgment that all created things
were the work and effect of some immense and infinite
cause, the which only the First Cause and true God is....
And in Mexico alone (according to the common
opinion) they had and adored two thousand gods, of whom
the principal were Vizilipuztli and Tezcatlipucatl, who
as supreme were set up in the height of the great temple,
over two altars.... Tezcatlipucatl was the god of providence,
and Vizilipuztli the god of war."<a id="FNanchor_VI-25" href="#Footnote_VI-25" class="fnanchor">[VI-25]</a></p>

<p>Speaking of Mexican temples<a id="FNanchor_VI-26" href="#Footnote_VI-26" class="fnanchor">[VI-26]</a> and gods, Oviedo says:
"But Montezuma had the chief [temple], together with
three other prayer-houses, in which he sacrificed in
honor of four gods, or idols, that he had; of these they
had one for god of war, as the Gentiles had Mars; to
another they gave honor and sacrifice as god of the
waters, even as the ancients gave to Neptune; another they
adored for god of the wind, as the lost heathen adored
Æolus; and another still they revered as their sovereign
god, and this was the sun.... They had further other
gods; making one of them god of the maize-fields, attributing
to him the power of guarding and multiplying
the same, as the fable-writing poets and ancients of antiquity
did to Ceres. They had gods for everything,
giving attributes to each according to their surmises, investing
them with that godhead which they had not, and
with which it was not right to invest any save only the
true God."<a id="FNanchor_VI-27" href="#Footnote_VI-27" class="fnanchor">[VI-27]</a></p>

<p>Speaking in general terms of probably a large part of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">193</a></span>
New Spain, Torquemada, says: "These idolaters did
not deny that they had a god called Ypalnemoaloni, that
is to say, Lord by whom we live, and his nature is that
his existence is in himself:<a id="FNanchor_VI-28" href="#Footnote_VI-28" class="fnanchor">[VI-28]</a> the which is most proper
to God, who is in his essence life. But that in which
these people erred was in distributing this divinity and
attributing it to many gods; yet, in reality, and verily,
they recognized a Supreme God, to whom all the others
were inferior. But for the greatness of their sins, they
lacked faith and ran into this error like the other nations
that have done so."</p>

<p class="sidenote">ACOSTA AND TEOTL.</p>

<p>Acosta, as has been already noticed by Professor J.
G. Müller, either never heard of or disbelieved in the
existence of the name Teotl and of the ideas connected
therewith by so many historians.<a id="FNanchor_VI-29" href="#Footnote_VI-29" class="fnanchor">[VI-29]</a> The said Acosta
says: "If wee shall seeke into the Indian tongue for a
word to answer to this name of God, as in Latin, Deus;
in Greeke, Theos; in Hebrew, El; in Arabike, Alla; but
wee shall not finde any in the Cuscan or Mexicaine
tongues. So as such as preach, or write to the Indians,
vse our Spanish name Dios, fitting it to the accent or
pronounciation of the Indian tongues; the which differ
much, whereby appeares the small knowledge they had
of God, seeing they cannot so much as name him, if
it be not by our very name: yet in trueth they had
some little knowledge.... The Mexicaines almost in the
same manner [as the Peruvians] after the supreame God,
worshiped the Sunne: And therefore they called Hernando
Cortez, Sonne of the Sunne, for his care and
courage to compasse the earth. But they made their
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">194</a></span>
greatest adoration to an Idol called Vitzilipuztli, the
which in all this region they called the most puissant
and Lord of all things: for this cause the Mexicaines
built him a Temple, the greatest, the fairest, the highest,
and the most sumptuous of all others.... But heere
the Mexicaines Idolatrie hath bin more pernicious and
hurtfull than that of the Inguas, as wee shall see plainer
heereafter, for that the greatest part of their adoration
and idolatrie, was employed to Idols, and not to naturall
things, although they did attribute naturall effects to
these Idolls, as raine, multiplication of cattell, warre, and
generation, even as the Greekes and Latins have forged
Idolls of Ph&oelig;bus, Mercurie, Jupiter, Minerva, and of
Mars. To conclude, who so shall neerely looke into it,
shall finde this manner which the Divell hath vsed to
deceive the Indians, to be the same wherewith hee hath
deceived the Greekes and Romans, and other ancient
Gentiles, giving them to vnderstand that these notable
creatures, the Sunne, Moone, Starres, and Elements, had
power and authoritie to doe good or harme to men."<a id="FNanchor_VI-30" href="#Footnote_VI-30" class="fnanchor">[VI-30]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">MENDIETA'S EUHEMERISTIC THEORY.</p>

<p>Mendieta says: "It is to be noted for a general rule
that, though these people, in all the continent of these
Indias, from the farthest parts of New Spain to the parts
of Florida, and farther still to the kingdoms of Peru,
had, as has been said, an infinity of idols that they
reverenced as gods, nevertheless, above all, they still
held the sun as chiefest and most powerful. And they
dedicated to the sun the greatest, richest, and most
sumptuous of their temples. This should be the power
the Mexicans called Ipalnemohuani, that is to say, 'by
whom all live,' and Moyucuyatzin ayac oquiyocux ayac
oquipic, that is to say, 'he that no one created or formed,
but who, on the contrary, made all things by his own
power and will.' ... So many are the fictions and fables
that the Indians invented about their gods, and so
differently are these related in the different towns, that
neither can they agree among themselves in recounting
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">195</a></span>
them, nor shall there be found any one who shall understand
them. In the principal provinces of this New
Spain, they had&mdash;after the sun, which was the common
god of them all&mdash;each province, its particular and principal
god, to which god above all others they offered
their sacrifices; as the Mexicans to Uzilopuchtli&mdash;a name
that the Spaniards not being able to pronounce called
Ocholobos, 'eight wolves', or Uchilobos; as the Tezucans
to Tezcatlipuca; as the Tlaxcalans to Camaxtli, and
as the Cholulans to Quetzalcoatl; doubtless all
these were famous men that performed some notable
feats, or invented some new thing, to the honor and
benefit of the state; or perhaps again these gave the
people laws and a rule of life, or taught them trades, or
to offer up sacrifices, or some other thing that appeared
good and worthy to be rewarded with grateful acknowledgements....
The demon, the old enemy, did not
content himself with the service that these people did
him in the adoration of almost every visible creature,
in making idols of them, both carven and painted, but
he also kept them blinded with a thousand fashions of
witchcrafts, parodies of sacraments, and superstitions."<a id="FNanchor_VI-31" href="#Footnote_VI-31" class="fnanchor">[VI-31]</a></p>

<p>"It is well to remark," writes Camargo, "that although
the Indians had a divinity for each thing, they were
aware of the existence of a Supreme God that they named
Tloque-Nahuaque, or He who contains all, regarding the
same as superior to all the other gods." This Tlascaltec
author has also preserved us a native prayer couched in
the following terms: "O, all-powerful gods, that inhabit
the heavens, even as far as the ninth, where abides your
master and ours, the great Tloque-Nahuaque (this name
means, He that accompanies the other gods<a id="FNanchor_VI-32" href="#Footnote_VI-32" class="fnanchor">[VI-32]</a>)&mdash;you that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">196</a></span>
have all power over men forsake us not in danger. We
invoke you, as well also as the sun Nauholin, and the
moon, spouse of that brilliant luminary, the stars of
heaven also, and the wind of the night and of the day."<a id="FNanchor_VI-33" href="#Footnote_VI-33" class="fnanchor">[VI-33]</a></p>

<p>According to the somewhat vague and incomplete account
of Fray Toribio de Benavente, or Motolinia&mdash;the
latter his adopted name and that by which he is best
known&mdash;another of the original and early authorities in
matter concerning the gentile Mexicans: "Tezcatlipoca
was the god or demon that they held for greatest and
to whom most dignity was attributed.... They had
idols of stone, and of wood, and of baked clay; they also
made them of dough and of seeds kneaded into the
dough.... Some of them were shaped like men, ... some
were like women; ... some were like wild beasts, as lions,
tigers, dogs, deer, and such other animals as frequented
the mountains and plains; ... some like snakes of many
fashions, large and coiling.... Of the owl and other
night-birds, and of others as the kite, and of every large
bird, or beautiful, or fierce, or preciously feathered&mdash;they
had an idol. But the principal of all was the sun.
Likewise had they idols of the moon and stars, and of
the great fishes, and of the water-lizards, and of toads and
frogs, and of other fishes; and these they said were the
gods of the fishes.... They had for gods fire, water, and
earth; and of all these they had painted figures.... Of
many other things they had figures and idols, carved or
painted, even of butterflies, fleas, and locusts."<a id="FNanchor_VI-34" href="#Footnote_VI-34" class="fnanchor">[VI-34]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE CREED OF NEZAHUALCOYOTL.</p>

<p>Nezahualcoyotl, king of Tezcuco, was he who&mdash;according
to the no doubt somewhat partial account of his descendant
Ixtlilxochitl&mdash;pushed the farthest into overt
speech and act his contempt of the vulgar idolatry and
his recognition of a high, holy, and to a great extent
unknowable supreme power. This thoughtful monarch
"found for false all the gods adored by the people of
this land, saying that they were statues and demons
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">197</a></span>
hostile to the human race; for he was very learned in
moral things, and he went to and fro more than any
other, seeking if haply he might find light to affirm the
true God and creator of all things, as has been seen in
the discourse of his history, and as bear witness the songs
that he composed on this theme. He said that there
was only One, that this One was the maker of heaven
and earth, that he sustained all he had made and created,
and that he was where was no second, above the nine
heavens; that no eye had ever seen this One, in a human
shape nor in any shape whatever; that the souls of the
virtuous went to him after death, while the souls of the
bad went to another place, some most infamous spot of
earth, filled with horrible hardships and sufferings.
Never&mdash;though there were many gods representing many
idols&mdash;did the king neglect an opportunity of saying
when divinity was discussed, 'yntloque in nauhaque y
palne moalani,' which sentence sums up his convictions
as above expressed. Nevertheless he recognized the sun
as his father and the earth as his mother."<a id="FNanchor_VI-35" href="#Footnote_VI-35" class="fnanchor">[VI-35]</a></p>

<p>Now it is in the face of much that has been said denying
or doubting Ixtlilxochitl's account of the creed of
Nezahualcoyotl that I have selected the passage above
translated, from among other passages touching the same
subject in the <i>Historia Chichimeca</i> and in the <i>Relaciones</i>.
I have selected it not because it is the most clearly
worded, or the most eloquent, or the most complete; but
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">198</a></span>
solely on account of the sentence with which it concludes:
Nezahualcoyotl "recognized the sun as his father
and the earth as his mother." These few words occurring
at the end of a eulogy of the great Tezcucan by a
confessed admirer, these few words that have passed unnoticed
amid the din and hubbub raised over the lofty
creed to which they form the last article, these few words
so insignificant apparently and yet so significant in their
connection&mdash;should go far to prove the faithfulness
of Ixtlilxochitl's record, and the greater or less completeness
of his portrait of his great ancestor. Were Ixtlilxochitl
dishonest, would he ever have allowed such a pagan
chord as this to come jangling into the otherwise perfect
music of his description of a perfect sage and Christian,
who believed in a God alone and all-sufficient, who believed
in a creator of all things without any help at all,
much less the help of his dead material creatures the sun
and the earth? Let us admit the honesty of Ixtlilxochitl,
and admit with him a knowledge of that Unknown
God, whom, as did the Athenians, Nezahualcoyotl ignorantly
worshiped; but let us not be blinded by a glitter
of words&mdash;which we may be sure lose nothing in the
repetition&mdash;as to the significance of that 'ignorantly;'
let us never lose sight across the shadow of that obscure
Athenian altar to the Unknown God, of the mighty
columns of the Acropolis and the crest of the Athena
Promachos. Nezahualcoyotl seems a fair type of a
thoughtful, somewhat sceptical Mexican of that better-instructed
class which is ever and everywhere the horror
of hypocrites and fanatics, of that class never without
its witnesses in all countries and at all times, of that
class two steps above the ignorant laity, and one step
above the learned priesthood, yet far still from that simple
and perfect truth which shall one day be patent enough
to all.</p>

<p class="sidenote">AMERICAN MYTHOLOGY.</p>

<p>Turning from the discussion of a point so obscure and
intangible as the monotheism of Nezahualcoyotl and the
school of which he was the type, let us review the very
palpable and indubitable polytheism of the Mexicans.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">199</a></span>
It seems radically to differ little from other polytheisms
better known, such as those of Greece, Rome, and Scandinavia;
it seems to have been a jumble of personified
powers, causes, and qualities, developed in the ordinary
way from the mythical corruption of that florid hyperbolical
style of speech natural to all peoples in days
before the exact definition of words was either possible
or necessary; just such a jumble as the Aryan
polytheisms were in the days of the Euhemerists, and for
too long after unfortunately; such a jumble as Aryan
mythology was till the brothers Grimm led the van of
the ripest talent and scholarship of the nineteenth century
into the paths of 'word-shunting,' which led again
into god or hero shunting, if the term may be invented.
Unfortunately the philologic and mythologic material for
such an exhaustive synthesis of the origin and relations
of the American creeds as Mr Cox, for example, has
given to the world on the Aryan legends, in his <i>Mythology
of the Aryan Nations</i>, is yet far from complete; which fact
indeed makes the raison d'être of works like the present.
There is nothing for me at present but to gather, sift, and
arrange, with such sifting and arrangement as may be possible,
all accessible materials relating to the subject in hand;
that done let more skilled workmen find and give them
their place in the wall of science. For they have a
place there, whether or no it be found to-day or to-morrow;
a breach is there that shall be empty until they
fit and fill it.</p>

<p class="p2">Tezcatlipoca seems to have been considered on the
whole, and the patron-gods of different cities aside, as the
most important of the Mexican gods. We have seen
him identified in several of the preceding quotations
with a supreme invisible god, and I now proceed, illustrating
this phase of his character, to translate as closely
as possible the various prayers given by Sahagun as addressed
to this great deity under his various names,
Titlacoan, Yautl, Telpuchtli, Tlamatzincatl, Moiocoiatzin,
Iaotzin, Necociautl, Necaoalpilli, and others:&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">200</a></span></p>

<p>O, thou almighty God, that givest life to men, and
art called Titlacaoan, grant me in thy mercy everything
needful to eat and to drink, and to enjoy of thy soft and
delicate things; for in grievous toil and straitness I live
in the world. Have mercy on me, so poor I am and
naked, I that labor in thy service, and for thy service
sweep, and clean, and put light in this poor house, where
I await thine orders; otherwise let me die soon and end
this toilful and miserable life, so that my body may find
rest and a breathing-time.</p>

<p>In illness the people prayed to this deity as follows:
O God, whose name is Titlacaoan, be merciful and send
away this sickness which is killing me, and I will reform
my life. Let me be once healed of this infirmity and I
swear to serve thee and to earn the right to live; should
I by hard toil gain something, I will not eat it nor
employ it in anything save only to thine honor; I will
give a feast and a banquet of dancing in this poor house.</p>

<p>But the sick man that could not recover, and that felt
it so, used to grow desperate and blaspheme saying: O
Titlacaoan, since thou mockest me, why dost thou not
kill me?<a id="FNanchor_VI-36" href="#Footnote_VI-36" class="fnanchor">[VI-36]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">PRAYER IN TIME OF PESTILENCE.</p>
<p class="sidenote">SPARE THE GREEN AND TAKE THE RIPE.</p>

<p>Then following is a prayer to Tezcatlipoca, used by
the priest in time of pestilence: O mighty Lord, under
whose wing we find defense and shelter, thou art invisible
and impalpable even as night and the air. How
can I that am so mean and worthless dare to appear before
thy majesty? Stuttering and with rude lips I speak;
ungainly is the manner of my speech as one leaping
among furrows, as one advancing unevenly; for all this
I fear to raise thine anger, and to provoke instead of appeasing
thee; nevertheless thou wilt do unto me as may
please thee. O Lord, that hast held it good to forsake
us in these days, according to the counsel thou hast as
well in heaven as in hades&mdash;alas for us, in that thine
anger and indignation has descended in these days
upon us; alas, in that the many and grievous afflictions
of thy wrath have overgone and swallowed us up,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">201</a></span>
coming down even as stones, spears, and arrows upon the
wretches that inhabit the earth&mdash;this is the sore pestilence
with which we are afflicted and almost destroyed.
Alas, O valiant and all-powerful Lord, the common people
are almost made an end of and destroyed; a great
destruction and ruin the pestilence already makes in
this nation; and, what is most pitiful of all, the little
children that are innocent and understand nothing,
only to play with pebbles and to heap up little mounds
of earth, they too die, broken and dashed to pieces as
against stones and a wall&mdash;a thing very pitiful and grievous
to be seen, for there remain of them not even those in
the cradles, nor those that could not walk nor speak.
Ah, Lord, how all things become confounded; of young
and old and of men and women there remains neither
branch nor root; thy nation and thy people and thy
wealth are leveled down and destroyed. O our Lord,
protector of all, most valiant and most kind, what is this?
Thine anger and thine indignation, does it glory or delight
in hurling the stone and arrow and spear? The fire of the
pestilence, made exceeding hot, is upon thy nation, as a fire
in a hut, burning and smoking, leaving nothing upright or
sound. The grinders of thy teeth are employed, and thy
bitter whips upon the miserable of thy people, who have
become lean and of little substance, even as a hollow green
cane. Yea, what doest thou now, O Lord, most strong,
compassionate, invisible, and impalpable, whose will
all things obey, upon whose disposal depends the rule of
the world, to whom all is subject&mdash;what in thy divine
breast hast thou decreed? Peradventure hast thou altogether
forsaken thy nation and thy people? Hast thou
verily determined that it utterly perish, and that there
be no more memory of it in the world, that the peopled
place become a wooded hill and a wilderness of stones?
Peradventure wilt thou permit that the temples, and
the places of prayer, and the altars, built for thy service,
be razed and destroyed and no memory of them be left?
Is it indeed possible that thy wrath and punishment,
and vexed indignation are altogether implacable and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">202</a></span>
will go on to the end to our destruction? Is it already
fixed in thy divine counsel that there is to be no mercy
nor pity for us, until the arrows of thy fury are spent to
our utter perdition and destruction? Is it possible that
this lash and chastisement is not given for our correction
and amendment, but only for our total destruction
and obliteration; that the sun shall nevermore
shine upon us, but that we must remain in perpetual
darkness and silence; that nevermore thou wilt look
upon us with eyes of mercy, neither little nor much?
Wilt thou after this fashion destroy the wretched sick
that cannot find rest nor turn from side to side,
whose mouth and teeth are filled with earth and
scurf? It is a sore thing to tell how we are all in darkness,
having none understanding nor sense to watch for
or aid one another. We are all as drunken and without
understanding, without hope of any aid; already the
little children perish of hunger, for there is none to give
them food, nor drink, nor consolation, nor caress&mdash;none to
give the breast to them that suck; for their fathers and
mothers have died and left them orphans, suffering
for the sins of their fathers. O our Lord, all-powerful,
full of mercy, our refuge, though indeed
thine anger and indignation, thine arrows and stones, have
sorely hurt this poor people, let it be as a father or a
mother that rebukes children, pulling their ears, pinching
their arms, whipping them with nettles, pouring
chill water upon them; all being done that they may
amend their puerility and childishness. Thy chastisement
and indignation have lorded and prevailed over
these thy servants, over this poor people, even as rain
falling upon the trees and the green canes, being touched
of the wind, drops also upon those that are below. O most
compassionate Lord, thou knowest that the common folk
are as children, that being whipped they cry and sob and
repent of what they have done. Peradventure, already
these poor people by reason of thy chastisement weep, sigh,
blame, and murmur against themselves; in thy presence
they blame and bear witness against their bad deeds and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">203</a></span>
punish themselves therefor. Our Lord most compassionate,
pitiful, noble, and precious, let a time be given the
people to repent; let the past chastisement suffice, let it
end here, to begin again if the reform endure not. Pardon
and overlook the sins of the people; cause thine
anger and thy resentment to cease; repress it again
within thy breast that it destroy no farther; let it rest
there; let it cease, for of a surety none can avoid
death nor escape to any place. We owe tribute to death;
and all that live in the world are the vassals thereof;
this tribute shall every man pay with his life. None
shall avoid from following death, for it is thy messenger
what hour soever it may be sent, hungering and thirsting
always to devour all that are in the world and so
powerful that none shall escape: then indeed shall every
man be punished according to his deeds. O most pitiful
Lord, at least take pity and have mercy upon the children
that are in the cradles, upon those that cannot walk.
Have mercy also, O Lord, upon the poor and very miserable,
who have nothing to eat, nor to cover themselves
withal, nor a place to sleep, who do not know what thing
a happy day is, whose days pass altogether in pain,
affliction, and sadness. Than this, were it not better,
O Lord, if thou should forget to have mercy upon the
soldiers and upon the men of war, whom thou wilt have
need of sometime; behold it is better to die in war and
go to serve food and drink in the house of the sun, than
to die in this pestilence and descend to hades. O most
strong Lord, protector of all, lord of the earth, governor
of the world, and universal master, let the sport and satisfaction
thou hast already taken in this past punishment
suffice; make an end of this smoke and fog of thy resentment;
quench also the burning and destroying fire of
thine anger: let serenity come and clearness; let the
small birds of thy people begin to sing and to approach
the sun; give them quiet weather so that they may
cause their voices to reach thy highness and thou mayest
know them. O our Lord, most strong, most compassionate,
and most noble, this little have I said before thee,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">204</a></span>
and I have nothing more to say, only to prostrate and
throw myself at thy feet, seeking pardon for the faults
of this my prayer; certainly I would not remain in thy
displeasure, and I have no other thing to say.</p>

<p class="sidenote">PRAYER FOR AID AGAINST POVERTY.</p>

<p>The following is a prayer to the same deity, under his
names Tezcatlipuca and Yoalliehecatl, for succor against
poverty: O our Lord, protector most strong and compassionate,
invisible, and impalpable, thou art the giver
of life; lord of all, and lord of battles, I present myself
here before thee to say some few words concerning the
need of the poor people, the people of none estate nor
intelligence. When they lie down at night they have
nothing, nor when they rise up in the morning; the
darkness and the light pass alike in great poverty.
Know, O Lord, that thy subjects and servants, suffer a
sore poverty that cannot be told of more than that it is
a sore poverty and desolateness. The men have no garments
nor the women to cover themselves with, but only
certain rags rent in every part that allow the air and the
cold to pass everywhere. With great toil and weariness
they scrape together enough for each day, going by
mountain and wilderness seeking their food; so faint and
enfeebled are they that their bowels cleave to the ribs,
and all their body reëchoes with hollowness; and they
walk as people affrighted, the face and the body in likeness
of death. If they be merchants, they now sell
only cakes of salt and broken pepper; the people that
have something despise their wares, so that they go out
to sell from door to door and from house to house; and
when they sell nothing they sit down sadly by some fence,
or wall, or in some corner, licking their lips and gnawing
the nails of their hands for the hunger that is in
them; they look on the one side and on the other at the
mouths of those that pass by, hoping peradventure that
one may speak some word to them. O compassionate
God, the bed on which they lie down is not a thing to
rest upon, but to endure torment in; they draw a rag
over them at night and so sleep; there they throw down
their bodies and the bodies of children that thou hast
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">205</a></span>
given them. For the misery they grow up in, for the
filth<a id="FNanchor_VI-37" href="#Footnote_VI-37" class="fnanchor">[VI-37]</a> of their food, for the lack of covering, their faces
are yellow and all their bodies of the color of earth.
They tremble with cold, and for leanness they stagger in
walking. They go weeping, and sighing, and full of
sadness, and all misfortunes are joined to them; though
they stay by a fire they find little heat. O our Lord,
most clement, invisible, and impalpable, I supplicate
thee to see good to have pity upon them as they move in
thy presence wailing and clamoring and seeking mercy
with anguish of heart. O our Lord, in whose power it
is to give all content, consolation, sweetness, softness,
prosperity and riches, for thou alone art lord of all good&mdash;have
mercy upon them for they are thy servants. I
supplicate thee, O Lord, that thou prove them a little
with tenderness, indulgence, sweetness, and softness,
which indeed they sorely lack and require. I supplicate
thee that thou will lift up their heads with thy favor
and aid, that thou will see good that they enjoy some
days of prosperity and tranquillity, so they may sleep and
know repose, having prosperous and peaceable days of
life. Should they still refuse to serve thee, thou afterwards
canst take away what thou hast given; they having
enjoyed it but a few days, as those that enjoy a fragrant
and beautiful flower and find it wither presently. Should
this nation, for whom I pray and entreat thee to do them
good, not understand what thou hast given, thou canst
take away the good and pour out cursing; so that all
evil may come upon them, and they become poor, in
need, maimed, lame, blind, and deaf: then indeed they
shall waken and know the good that they had and have
not, and they shall call upon thee and lean towards thee;
but thou wilt not listen, for in the day of abundance
they would not understand thy goodness towards them.
In conclusion, I supplicate thee, O most kind and benificent
Lord, that thou will see good to give this people
to taste of the goods and riches that thou art wont to
give, and that proceed from thee, things sweet and soft
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">206</a></span>
and bringing content, and joy, although it be but for a little
while, and as a dream that passes. For it is certain that
for a long time the people go sadly before thee, weeping
and thoughtful, because of the anguish, hardship, and
anxiety that fill their bodies and hearts, taking away all
ease and rest. Verily, it is not doubtful that to this poor
nation, needy and shelterless, happens all I have said.
If thou answerest my petition it will be only of thy
liberality and magnificence, for no one is worthy to receive
thy bounty for any merit of his, but only through
thy grace. Search below the dung-hills and in the
mountains for thy servants, friends, and acquaintance,
and raise them to riches and dignities. O our Lord,
most clement, let thy will be done as it is ordained in
thy heart, and we shall have nothing to say. I, a rude
man and common, would not by importunity and prolixity
disgust and annoy thee, detailing my sickness,
destruction, and punishment. Whom do I speak to?
Where am I? Lo I speak with thee, O King; well do I
know that I stand in an eminent place, and that I talk
with one of great majesty, before whose presence
flows a river through a chasm, a gulf sheer down of
awful depth; this also is a slippery place, whence many
precipitate themselves, for there shall not be found one
without error before thy majesty. I myself, a man of
little understanding and lacking speech, dare to address
my words to thee; I put myself in peril of falling into the
gorge and cavern of this river. I, Lord, have come to
take with my hands blindness to mine eyes, rottenness
and shrivelling to my members, poverty and
affliction to my body; for my meanness and rudeness
this it is that I merit to receive. Live and rule for
ever in all quietness and tranquillity, O thou that art our
lord, our shelter, our protector, most compassionate, most
pitiful, invisible, impalpable.</p>

<p class="sidenote">PRAYER IN TIME OF WAR.</p>
<p class="sidenote">PRAYER TO THE GOD OF BATTLES.</p>

<p>This following is a petition in time of war to the same
principal god, under his name of Tezcatlipoca Yautlnecociautlmonenequi,
praying favor against the enemy: O our
Lord, most compassionate, protector, defender, invisible,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">207</a></span>
impalpable, by whose will and wisdom we are directed
and governed, beneath whose rule we live&mdash;O, Lord
of battles, it is a thing very certain and settled that war
begins to be arranged and prepared for. The god of
the earth opens his mouth, thirsty to drink the blood
of them that shall die in this strife. It seems that they
wish to be merry, the sun and the god of the earth
called Tlaltecutli; they wish to give to eat and drink to
the gods of heaven and hades, making them a banquet
with the blood and flesh of the men that have to die in
this war. Already do they look, the gods of heaven
and hades, to see who they are that have to conquer,
and who to be conquered; who they are that
have to slay, and who to be slain; whose blood
it is that has to be drunken, and whose flesh it is
that has to be eaten;&mdash;which things the noble fathers
and mothers whose sons have to die, are ignorant of.
Even so are ignorant all their kith and kin, and the
nurses that gave them suck&mdash;ignorant also are the fathers
that toiled for them, seeking things needful for
their food and drink and raiment until they reached the
age they now have. Certainly they could not foretell
how those sons should end whom they reared so anxiously,
or that they should be one day left captives or
dead upon the field. See good, O our Lord, that the
nobles who die in the shock of war be peacefully and
agreeably received, and with bowels of love, by the sun
and the earth that are father and mother of all. For
verily thou dost not deceive thyself in what thou doest,<a id="FNanchor_VI-38" href="#Footnote_VI-38" class="fnanchor">[VI-38]</a>
to wit, in wishing them to die in war; for certainly
for this didst thou send them into the world, so
that with their flesh and their blood they might be
for meat and drink to the sun and the earth. Be not
wroth, O Lord, anew against those of the profession of
war, for in the same place where they will die have died
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">208</a></span>
many generous<a id="FNanchor_VI-39" href="#Footnote_VI-39" class="fnanchor">[VI-39]</a> and noble lords and captains, and
valiant men. The nobility and generosity of the nobles
and the great-heartedness of the warriors is made apparent,
and thou makest manifest, O Lord, how estimable
and precious is each one, so that as such he may be held
and honored, even as a stone of price or a rich feather.
O Lord, most clement, lord of battles, emperor of all,
whose name is Tezcatlipoca, invisible and impalpable,
we supplicate thee that he or they that thou wilt permit
to die in this war may be received into the house of
the sun in heaven, with love and honor, and may be
placed and lodged between the brave and famous warriors
already dead in war, to wit, the lords Quitzicquaquatzin,
Maceuhcatzin, Tlacahuepantzin, Ixtlilcuechavac,
Ihuitltemuc, Chavacuetzin, and all the other valiant and
renowned men that died in former times&mdash;who are rejoicing
with and praising our lord the sun, who are glad
and eternally rich through him, and shall be for ever;
they go about sucking the sweetness of all flowers delectable
and pleasant to the taste. This is a great dignity
for the stout and valiant ones that died in war; for this
they are drunken with delight, keeping no account of
night, nor day, nor years, nor times; their joy and their
wealth is without end; the nectarous flowers they sip
never fade, and for the desire thereof men of high descent
strengthen themselves to die. In conclusion, I
entreat thee, O Lord, that art our lord most clement,
our emperor most invincible, to see good that those that
die in this war be received with bowels of pity and love
by our father the sun, and our mother the earth; for
thou only livest and rulest and art our most compassionate
lord. Nor do I supplicate alone for the illustrious and
noble, but also for the other soldiers, who are troubled and
tormented in heart, who clamor, calling upon thee,
holding their lives as nothing, and who fling themselves
without fear upon the enemy, seeking death. Grant
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">209</a></span>
them at least some small part of their desire, some rest
and repose in this life; or if here, in this world, they are
not destined to prosperity, appoint them for servants and
officers of the sun, to give food and drink to those in
hades and to those in heaven. As for those whose charge
it is to rule the state and to be tlacateccatl or tlacochcalatl,<a id="FNanchor_VI-40" href="#Footnote_VI-40" class="fnanchor">[VI-40]</a>
make them to be fathers and mothers to the men
of war that wander by field and mountain, by height
and ravine&mdash;in their hand is the sentence of death for
enemies and criminals, as also the distribution of dignities,
the offices and the arms of war, the badges, the
granting privileges to those that wear visors and tassels<a id="FNanchor_VI-41" href="#Footnote_VI-41" class="fnanchor">[VI-41]</a>
on the head, and ear-rings, pendants, and bracelets, and
have yellow skins tied to their ankles&mdash;with them is the
privilege of appointing the fashion of the raiment that
every one shall wear. It is to these also to give permission
to certain to use and wear precious stones, as
chalchivetes, turquoises, and rich feathers in the dances,
and to wear necklaces and jewels of gold: all of which
things are delicate and precious gifts proceeding from
thy riches, and which thou givest to those that perform
feats and valiant deeds in war. I entreat thee also, O
Lord, to make grace of thy largess to the common
soldiers, give them some shelter and good lodging in this
world, make them stout and brave, and take away all
cowardice from their heart, so that not only shall they
meet death with cheerfulness, but even desire it as a
sweet thing, as flowers and dainty food, nor dread at all
the hoots and shouts of their enemies: this do to them
as to thy friend. Forasmuch as thou art lord of battles,
on whose will depends the victory, aiding whom thou
wilt, needing not that any counsel thee&mdash;I entreat thee,
O Lord, to make mad and drunken our enemies so that
without hurt to us they may cast themselves into our
hands, into the hands of our men of war enduring
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">210</a></span>
so much hardship and poverty. O our Lord, since
thou art God, all-powerful, all-knowing, disposer of all
things, able to make this land rich, prosperous, praised,
honored, famed in the art and feats of war, able to make
the warriors now in the field to live and be prosperous,
if, in the days at hand, thou see good that they die in
war, let it be to go to the house of the sun, among all
the heroes that are there and that died upon the battle-field.</p>

<p class="sidenote">PRAYER THAT A RULER MAY RULE WELL.</p>

<p class="sidenote">THAT A RULER MAY NOT ABUSE HIS POWER.</p>

<p>The following prayer is one addressed to the principal
deity, under his name Tezcatlipoca Teiocoiani Tehimatini,
asking favor for a newly elected ruler: To-day, a
fortunate day, the sun has risen upon us, warming us, so
that in it a precious stone may be wrought, and a handsome
sapphire. To us has appeared a new light, has
arrived a new brightness, to us has been given a glittering
axe to rule and govern our nation&mdash;has been given
a man to take upon his shoulders the affairs and troubles
of the state. He is to be the image and substitute of
the lords and governors that have already passed away
from this life, who for some days labored, bearing
the burden of thy people, possessing thy throne and
seat, which is the principal dignity<a id="FNanchor_VI-42" href="#Footnote_VI-42" class="fnanchor">[VI-42]</a> of this thy nation,
province, and kingdom; having and holding the same
in thy name and person some few days. These have
now departed from this life, put off their shoulders the
great load and burden that so few are able to suffer. Now,
O Lord, we marvel that thou hast indeed set thine eyes
on this man, rude and of little knowledge, to make him
for some days, for some little time, the governor of this
state, nation, province, and kingdom. O our Lord, most
clement, art thou peradventure in want of persons and
friends?&mdash;nay verily, thou that hast thereof more than
can be counted! Is it, peradventure, by error, or that
thou dost not know him; or is it that thou hast taken
him for the nonce, while thou seekest among many for
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">211</a></span>
another and a better than he, unwise, indiscrete, unprofitable,
a superfluous man in the world. Finally, we
give thanks to thy majesty for the favor thou hast done
us. What thy designs therein are thou alone knowest;
perhaps beforehand this office has been provided for:
thy will be done as it is determined in thy heart; let
this man serve for some days and times. It may be
that he will fill this office defectively, giving unrest and
fear to his subjects, doing things without counsel or consideration,
deeming himself worthy of the dignity he
has, thinking that he will remain in it for a long time,
making a sad dream of it, making the occupation and
dignity thou hast given him an occasion of pride and
presumption, making little of everybody and going about
with pomp and pageantry. Within a few days, thou wilt
know the event of all, for all men are thy spectacle and
theatre, at which thou laughest and makest thyself
merry. Perhaps this ruler will lose his office
through his childishness, or it will happen through his
carelessness and laziness; for verily nothing is hidden
from thee, thy sight makes way through stone and
wood, and thine hearing. Or perhaps his arrogance,
and the secret boasting of his thoughts will destroy him.
Then thou wilt throw him among the filth and upon the
dung-hills, and his reward will be blindness, and shrivellings,
and extreme poverty till the hour of his death,
when thou wilt put him under thy feet. Since this poor
man is put in this risk and peril, we supplicate thee,
who art our Lord, our invisible and impalpable protector,
under whose will and pleasure we are, who alone
disposes of and provides for all&mdash;we supplicate thee
that thou see good to deal mercifully with him; inasmuch
as he is needy, thy subject and servant, and blind;
deign to provide him with thy light, that he may know
what he has to think, what he has to do, and the road
he has to follow, so as to commit no error in his office,
contrary to thy disposition and will. Thou knowest
what is to happen to him in this office both by day and
night; we know, O our Lord, most clement, that our
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">212</a></span>
ways and deeds are not so much in our hands as in the
hands of our ruler. If this ruler after an evil and perverse
fashion, in the place to which thou hast elevated
him, and in the seat in which thou hast put him&mdash;which
is thine&mdash;where he manages the affairs of the people,
as one that washes filthy things with clean and clear
water, (yea in the same seat holds a similar cleansing
office the ancient god, who is father and mother to thyself,
and is god of fire, who stands in the midst of flowers,
in the midst of the place bounded by four walls, who is
covered with shining feathers that are as wings)&mdash;if this
ruler-elect of ours do evil with which to provoke thine
ire and indignation, and to awaken thy chastisement
against himself, it will not be of his own will or seeking,
but by thy permission or by some impulse from
without; for which I entreat thee to see good to open his
eyes to give him light; open also his ears and guide him,
not so much for his own sake as for that of those whom
he has to rule over and carry on his shoulders.<a id="FNanchor_VI-43" href="#Footnote_VI-43" class="fnanchor">[VI-43]</a> I supplicate
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">213</a></span>
thee, that now, from the beginning, thou inspire
him with what he is to conceive in his heart, and the
road he is to follow, inasmuch as thou hast made of him
a seat on which to seat thyself, and also as it were a
flute that, being played upon, may signify thy will.
Make him, O Lord, a faithful image of thyself, and permit
not that in thy throne and hall he make himself
proud and haughty; but rather see good, O Lord, that
quietly and prudently he rule and govern those in his
charge who are common people: do not permit him to
insult and oppress his subjects, nor to give over without
reason any of them to destruction. Neither permit, O
Lord, that he spot and defile thy throne and hall with
any injustice or oppression, for in so doing he will stain
also thine honor and fame. Already, O Lord, has this
poor man accepted and received the honor and lordship
that thou hast given him; already he possesses the glory
and riches thereof; already thou hast adorned his hands,
feet, head, ears, and lips, with visor, ear-rings, and bracelets,
and put yellow leather upon his ankles. Permit it
not, O Lord, that these decorations, badges, and ornaments
be to him a cause of pride and presumption; but rather
that he serve thee with humility and plainness. May it
please thee, O our Lord, most clement, that he rule and
govern this, thy seignory, that thou hast committed to
him, with all prudence and wisdom. May it please thee
that he do nothing wrong or to thine offense; deign to
walk with him and direct him in all his ways. But if
thou wilt not do this, ordain that from this day henceforth
he be abhorred and disliked, and that he die in
war at the hands of his enemies, that he depart to the
house of the sun; where he will be taken care of as a
precious stone, and his heart esteemed by the sun-lord;
he dying in the war like a stout and valiant man. This
would be much better than to be dishonored in the world,
to be disliked and abhorred of his people for his faults or
defects. O our Lord, thou that providest to all the
things needful for them, let this thing be done as I have
entreated and supplicated thee.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">214</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">THAT A RULER BE SET OVER THE NATION.</p>

<p>The next prayer, directed to the god under his name
Tezcatlipoca Titlacaoamoquequeloa, is to ask, after the
death of a ruler, that another may be given: O our
Lord, already thou knowest how our ruler is dead,
already thou hast put him under thy feet; he is gathered
to his place; he is gone by the road that all have to go
by, and to the house where all have to lodge; house of
perpetual darkness, where there is no window, nor any
light at all; he is now where none shall trouble his rest.
He served thee here in his office during some few days
and years, not indeed without fault and offense. Thou
gavest him to taste in this world somewhat of thy kindness
and favor, passing it before his face as a thing that
passes quickly. This is the dignity and office that thou
placedst him in, that he served thee in for some days, as
has been said, with sighs, tears and devout prayers before
thy majesty. Alas, he is gone now where our
father and mother the god of hades is, the god that
descended head foremost below the fire,<a id="FNanchor_VI-44" href="#Footnote_VI-44" class="fnanchor">[VI-44]</a> the god that
desires to carry us all to his place, with a very importunate
desire, with such a desire as one has that dies of
hunger and thirst; the god that is moved exceedingly,
both by day and night, crying and demanding that all
go to him. There, with this god, is now our late-departed
ruler; he is there with all his ancestors that were
in the first times, that governed this kingdom, with
Acamapichtli, with Tyzoc, with Avitzotl, with the first
Mocthecuzoma, with Axayacatl, and with those that
came last, as the second Mocthecuzoma and also Mocthecuzoma
Ilhuicamina.<a id="FNanchor_VI-45" href="#Footnote_VI-45" class="fnanchor">[VI-45]</a> All these lords and kings
ruled, governed, and enjoyed the sovereignty and royal
dignity, and throne and seat of this empire; they
ordered and regulated the affairs of this thy kingdom&mdash;thou
that art the universal lord and emperor, and that
needest not to take counsel with another. Already had
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">215</a></span>
these put off the intolerable load that they had on their
shoulders, leaving it to their successor, our late ruler, so
that for some days he bore up this lordship and kingdom;
but now he has passed on after his predecessors to the
other world. For thou didst ordain him to go, and didst
call him to give thanks for being unloaded of so great
a burden, quit of so sore a toil, and left in peace and
rest. Some few days we have enjoyed him, but now
forever he is absent from us, never more to return to
the world. Peradventure has he gone to any place
whence he can return here, so that his subjects may see
his face again? Will he come again to tell us to do this
or that? Will he come again to look to the consuls or
governors of the state? Peradventure will they see him
any more, or hear his decree and commandment? Will he
come any more to give consolation and comfort to his
principal men and his consuls? Alas, there is an end
to his presence, he is gone for ever. Alas, that our
candle has been quenched, and our light, that the axe
that shone with us is lost altogether. All his subjects and
inferiors, he has left in orphanage and without shelter.
Peradventure will he take care henceforward of this
city, province, and kingdom, though this city be destroyed
and leveled to the ground, with this seignory
and kingdom? O our Lord, most clement, is it a fit
thing that by the absence of him that died shall come to
the city, seignory, and kingdom some misfortune, in
which will be destroyed, undone, and affrighted the vassals
that live therein? For while living, he who has
died gave shelter under his wings, and kept his feathers
spread over the people. Great danger runs this your
city, seignory, and kingdom, if another ruler be not
elected immediately to be a shelter thereto. What is it
that thou art resolved to do? Is it good that thy people
be in darkness? Is it good that they be without head or
shelter? Is it thy will that they be leveled down and
destroyed? Woe for the poor and the little ones, thy
servants, that go seeking a father and mother, some one
to shelter and govern them, even as little children that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">216</a></span>
go weeping, seeking an absent father and mother, and
that grieve, not finding them. Woe for the merchants,
petty and poor, that go about by the mountains, deserts,
and meadows, woe also to the sad toilers that go about
seeking herbs to eat, roots and wood to burn, or to sell,
to eke out an existence withal. Woe for the poor soldiers,
for the men of war, that go about seeking death,
that abhor life, that think of nothing but the field and
the line where battle is given&mdash;upon whom shall they
call? who shall take a captive? to whom shall they present
the same? And if they themselves be taken captive,
to whom shall they give notice, that it may be
known in their land? Whom shall they take for father
and mother, so that in such a case favor may be granted
them? Since he whose duty it was to see to this, who
was as father and mother to all, is already dead. There
will be none to weep, to sigh for the captives, to tell
their relatives about them. Woe for the poor of the
litigants, for those that have lawsuits with those that
would take their estates. Who will judge, make peace
among, and clear them of their disputes and quarrels?
Behold when a child becomes dirty, if his mother clean
him not, he must remain filthy. And those that make
strife between themselves, that beat, that knock down,
who will keep peace between them? Those that for all
this go weeping and shedding tears, who shall wipe away
their tears and put a stop to their laments? Peradventure
can they apply a remedy to themselves? Those
deserving death, will they peradventure pass sentence
upon themselves? Who shall set up the throne of
justice? Who shall possess the hall of the judge,
since there is no judge? Who will ordain the
things that are necessary for the good of this city,
seignory, and kingdom? Who will elect the special
judges that have charge of the lower people, district by
district? Who will look to the sounding of the drum
and fife to gather the people for war? who will collect
and lead the soldiers and dexterous men to battle? O
our Lord and protector see good to elect and decide upon
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">217</a></span>
some person sufficient to fill your throne and bear upon
his shoulders the sore burden of the ruling of the state,
to gladden and cheer the common people, even as the
mother caresses the child, taking it in her lap; who will
make music to the troubled bees<a id="FNanchor_VI-46" href="#Footnote_VI-46" class="fnanchor">[VI-46]</a> so that they may be
at rest? O our Lord, most clement, favor our ruler-elect,
whom we deem fit for this office, elect and choose
him so that he may hold this your lordship and government;
give him as a loan your throne and seat, so that
he may rule over this seignory and kingdom as long as
he lives; lift him from the lowliness and humility in
which he is, and put on him this honor and dignity that
we think him worthy of; O our Lord, most clement, give
light and splendor with your hand to this state and kingdom.
What has been said I only come to propose to thy
majesty; although very defectively, as one that is drunken,
and that staggers, almost ready to fall. Do that
which may best serve thee, in all and through all.</p>

<p class="sidenote">PRAYER TO BE RID OF A BAD RULER.</p>

<p>What follows is a kind of greater excommunication,
or prayer to get rid of a ruler that abused and misused
his power and dignity: O our Lord, most clement, that
givest shelter to every one that approaches, even as a
tree of great height and breadth, thou that art invisible
and impalpable; that art, as we understand, able to
penetrate the stones and the trees, seeing what is contained
therein. For this same reason thou seest and
knowest what is within our hearts and readest our
thoughts. Our soul in thy presence is as a little smoke
or fog that rises from the earth. It cannot at all be
hidden from thee, the deed and the manner of living of
any one; for thou seest and knowest his secrets and the
sources of his pride and ambition. Thou knowest that
our ruler has a cruel and hard heart and abuses the
dignity that thou hast given him, as the drunkard abuses
his wine, as one drunken with a soporific;<a id="FNanchor_VI-47" href="#Footnote_VI-47" class="fnanchor">[VI-47]</a> that is to say
that the riches, dignity, and abundance that for a little
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">218</a></span>
while thou hast given him, fill him with error, haughtiness,
and unrest, and that he becomes a fool, intoxicated
with the poison that makes him mad. His prosperity
causes him to despise and make little of every one; it
seems that his heart is covered with sharp thorns and
also his face: all of which is made apparent by his manner
of living, and by his manner of talking; never saying
nor doing anything that gives pleasure to any one,
never caring for any one, never taking counsel of any one;
he ever lives as seems good to him and as the whim
directs. O our Lord, most clement, protector of all,
creator and maker of all, it is too certain that this man
has destroyed himself, has acted like a child ungrateful
to his father, like a drunkard without reason. The
favors thou hast accorded him, the dignity thou hast set
him in, have occasioned his perdition. Besides these,
there is another thing, exceedingly hurtful and reprehensible:
he is irreligious, never praying to the gods,
never weeping before them, nor grieving for his sins, nor
sighing; from this it comes about that he is as headstrong
as a drunkard in his vices, going about like a hollow and
empty person, wholly senseless; he stays not to consider
what he is nor the office that he fills. Of a verity he
dishonors and affronts the dignity and throne that he
holds, which is thine, and which ought to be much
honored and reverenced; for from it depends the justice
and rightness of the judicature that he holds, for the sustaining
and worthily directing of thy nation, thou being
emperor of all. He should so hold his power that the lower
people be not injured and oppressed by the great; from
him should fall punishment and humiliation on those
that respect not thy power and dignity. But all things
and people suffer loss in that he fills not his office as he
ought. The merchants suffer also, who are those to whom
thou givest the most of thy riches, who overrun all the
world, yea the mountains and the unpeopled places,
seeking through much sorrow thy gifts, favors, and dainties,
the which thou givest sparingly and to thy friends.
Ah, Lord, not only does he dishonor thee as aforesaid,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">219</a></span>
but also when we are gathered together to intone thy
songs, gathered in the place where we solicit thy mercies
and gifts, in the place where thou art praised and prayed
to, where the sad afflicted ones and the poor gather comfort
and strength, where very cowards find spirit to die
in war&mdash;in this so holy and reverend place this man
exhibits his dissoluteness and hurts devotion; he troubles
those that serve and praise thee in the place where thou
gatherest and markest thy friends, as a shepherd marks
his flock.<a id="FNanchor_VI-48" href="#Footnote_VI-48" class="fnanchor">[VI-48]</a> Since thou, Lord, hearest and knowest to be
true all that I have now said in thy presence, there remains
no more but that thy will be done, and the good
pleasure of thy heart to the remedy of this affair. At
least, O Lord, punish this man in such wise that he become
a warning to others, so that they may not imitate
his evil life. Let the punishment fall on him from thy
hand that to thee seems most meet, be it sickness or
any other affliction; or deprive him of the lordship, so
that thou mayest give it to another, to one of thy friends,
to one humble, devoted, and penitent; for many such
thou hast, thou that lackest not persons such as are
necessary for this office, friends that hope, crying to thee:
thou knowest those for friends and servants that weep
and sigh in thy presence every day. Elect some one of
these that he may hold the dignity of this thy kingdom
and seignory; make trial of some of these. And now,
O Lord, of all the aforesaid things which is it that thou
wilt grant? Wilt thou take from this ruler the lordship,
dignity, and riches on which he prides himself, and give
them to another who may be devout, penitent, humble,
obedient, capable, and of good understanding? Or, peradventure,
wilt thou be served by the falling of this
proud one into poverty and misery, as one of the poor
rustics that can hardly gather the wherewithal to eat,
drink, and clothe himself? Or, peradventure, will it
please thee to smite him with a sore punishment so that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">220</a></span>
all his body may shrivel up, or his eyes be made blind,
or his members rotten? Or wilt thou be pleased
to withdraw him from the world through death, and
send him to hades, to the house of darkness and obscurity,
where his ancestors are, whither we have all to go,
where our father is, and our mother, the god and the
goddess of hell. O our Lord, most clement, what is it
that thy heart desires the most? Let thy will be done.
And in this matter in which I supplicate thee, I am not
moved by envy nor hate; nor with any such motives
have I come into thy presence. I am moved only by
the robbery and ill-treatment that the people suffer, only
by a desire for their peace and prosperity. I would not
desire, O Lord, to provoke against myself thy wrath and
indignation, I that am a mean man and rude; for it is
to thee, O Lord, to penetrate the heart and to know the
thoughts of all mortals.</p>

<p class="sidenote">PRAYER USED BY A CONFESSOR OF SINS.</p>

<p>The following is a form of Mexican prayer to Tezcatlipoca,
used by the officiating confessor after having heard
a confession of sins from some one. The peculiarity of
a Mexican confession was that it could not lawfully have
place in a man's life more than once; a man's first absolution
and remission of sins was also the last and the only
one he had to hope for:&mdash;O our most compassionate
Lord, protector and favorer of all, thou hast now heard
the confession of this poor sinner, with which he has
published in thy presence his rottenness and unsavoriness.
Perhaps he has hidden some of his sins before
thee, and if it be so he has irreverently and offensively
mocked thy majesty, and thrown himself into a dark
cavern and into a deep ravine;<a id="FNanchor_VI-49" href="#Footnote_VI-49" class="fnanchor">[VI-49]</a> he has snared and entangled
himself; he has made himself worthy of blindness,
shrivelling and rotting of the members, poverty,
and misery. Alas, if this poor sinner have attempted
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">221</a></span>
any such audacity as to offend thus before thy majesty,
before thee that art lord and emperor of all, that keepest
a reckoning with all, he has tied himself up, he has made
himself vile, he has mocked himself. Thou thoroughly
seest him, for thou seest all things, being invisible and
without bodily parts. If he have done this thing, he has,
of his own will, put himself in this peril and risk; for
this is a place of very strict justice and very strait judgment.
This rite is like very clear water with which
thou washest away the faults of him that wholly confesses,
even if he have incurred destruction and
shortening of days; if indeed he have told all the
truth, and have freed and untied himself from his sins
and faults, he has received the pardon of them and of
what they have incurred. This poor man is even as a
man that has slipped and fallen in thy presence, offending
thee in divers ways, dirting himself also and casting
himself into a deep cavern, and a bottomless well.<a id="FNanchor_VI-50" href="#Footnote_VI-50" class="fnanchor">[VI-50]</a> He
fell like a poor and lean man, and now he is grieved and
discontented with all the past; his heart and body are
pained and ill at ease; he is now filled with heaviness
for having done what he did; he is now wholly determined
never to offend thee again. In thy presence, O
Lord, I speak, that knowest all things, that knowest
also that this poor wretch did not sin with an entire
liberty of free will; he was pushed to it and inclined by
the nature of the sign under which he was born. And
since this is so, O our Lord, most clement, protector and
helper of all, since also this poor man has gravely offended
thee, wilt thou not remove thine anger and thine indignation
from him? Give him time, O Lord; favor
and pardon him, inasmuch as he weeps, sighs, and sobs,
looking before him on the evil he has done, and on that
wherein he has offended thee. He is sorrowful, he sheds
many tears, the sorrow of his sins afflicts his heart; he
is not sorry only, but terrified also at thoughts of them.
This being so, it is also a just thing that thy fury and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">222</a></span>
indignation against him be appeased and that his sins
be thrown on one side. Since thou art full of pity, O
Lord, see good to pardon and to cleanse him; grant him
the pardon and remission of his sins, a thing that descends
from heaven, as water very clear and very pure
to wash away sins,<a id="FNanchor_VI-51" href="#Footnote_VI-51" class="fnanchor">[VI-51]</a> with which thou washest away all
the stain and impurity that sin causes in the soul. See
good, O Lord, that this man go in peace, and command
him in what he has to do; let him go to do penance for
and to weep over his sins; give him the counsels necessary
to his well living.</p>

<p class="sidenote">PERILS OF FALSE CONFESSION.</p>

<p class="sidenote">EXHORTATION TO THE PENITENT.</p>

<p>At this point the confessor ceases from addressing the
god and turns to the penitent, saying: O my brother, thou
hast come into a place of much peril, a place of travail
and fear; thou hast come to a steep chasm and a sheer
rock, where if any one fall he shall never come up again;
thou hast come to the very place where the snares and the
nets touch one another, where they are set one upon another,
in such wise that no one may pass thereby without
falling into some of them, and not only snares and nets
but also holes like wells. Thou hast thrown thyself down
the banks of the river and among the snares and nets,
whence without aid it is not possible that thou shouldst
escape. These thy sins are not only snares, nets, and
wells, into which thou hast fallen, but they are also wild
beasts that kill and rend both body and soul. Peradventure,
hast thou hidden some one or some of thy sins,
weighty, huge, filthy, unsavory, hidden something now
published in heaven, earth, and hades, something that
now stinks to the uttermost part of the world? Thou
hast now presented thyself before our most clement Lord
and protector of all, whom thou didst irritate, offend, and
provoke the anger of, who to-morrow, or some other
day, will take thee out of this world and put thee under
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">223</a></span>
his feet, and send thee to the universal house of hades,
where thy father is and thy mother, the god and the
goddess of hell, whose mouths are always open desiring
to swallow thee and as many as may be in the world.
In that place shall be given thee whatsoever thou didst
merit in this world, according to the divine justice, and
to what thou hast earned with thy works of poverty,
misery, and sickness. In divers manners thou wilt be
tormented and afflicted in the extreme, and wilt be soaked
in a lake of intolerable torments and miseries; but here,
at this time, thou hast had pity upon thyself in speaking
and communicating with our Lord, with him that sees
all the secrets of every heart. Tell therefore wholly all
that thou hast done, as one that flings himself into a
deep place, into a well without bottom. When thou wast
created and sent into the world, clean and good thou
wast created and sent; thy father and thy mother Quetzalcoatl
formed thee like a precious stone, and like a
bead of gold of much value; when thou wast born thou
wast like a rich stone and a jewel of gold very shining
and very polished. But of thine own will and volition
thou hast defiled and stained thyself, and rolled in
filth, and in the uncleanness of the sins and evil deeds
that thou hast committed and now confessed. Thou
hast acted as a child without judgment or understanding,
that playing and toying defiles himself with a loathsome
filth; so hast thou acted in the matter of the sins
that thou hast taken pleasure in, but hast now confessed
and altogether discovered before our Lord, who is the
protector and purifier of all sinners. This thou shalt
not take for an occasion of jesting, for verily thou hast
come to the fountain of mercy, which is like very clear
water, with which filthinesses of the soul are washed
away by our Lord God, the protector and favorer of all
that turn to him. Thou hast snatched thyself from
hades, and hast returned again to come to life in this
world, as one that comes from another. Now thou hast
been born anew, thou hast begun to live anew, and our
Lord God gives thee light and a new sun. Now once
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">224</a></span>
more thou beginnest to radiate and to shine anew like
a very precious and clear stone, issuing from the belly
of the matrix in which it was created. Since this is
thus, see that thou live with much circumspection and very
advisedly now and henceforward, all the time that thou
mayest live in this world under the power and lordship
of our Lord God, most clement, beneficent, and munificent.
Weep, be sad, walk humbly, with submission,
with the head low and bowed down, praying to God.
Look that pride find no place within thee, otherwise thou
wilt displease our Lord, who sees the hearts and the
thoughts of all mortals. In what dost thou esteem thyself?
At how much dost thou hold thyself? What is
thy foundation and root? On what dost thou support
thyself? It is clear that thou art nothing, canst do nothing,
and art worth nothing; for our Lord will do with
thee all he may desire and none shall stay his hand.
Peradventure, must he show thee those things with
which he torments and afflicts, so that thou mayest see
them with thine eyes in this world? Nay verily, for the
torments and horrible sufferings of his tortures of the
other world are not visible, nor able to be seen by those
that live here. Perhaps he will condemn thee to the
universal house of hades; and the house where thou now
livest will fall down and be destroyed, and be as a dung-hill
of filthiness and uncleanness, thou having been accustomed
to live therein with much satisfaction, waiting
to know how he would dispose of thee, he our Lord and
helper, the invisible, incorporeal and alone one. Therefore
I entreat thee to stand up and strengthen thyself and to
be no more henceforth as thou hast been in the past.
Take to thyself a new heart and a new manner of living,
and take good care not to turn again to thine old sins.
Consider that thou canst not see with thine eyes our
Lord God, for he is invisible and impalpable, he is Tezcatlipoca,
he is Titlacaoa, he is a youth of perfect perfection
and without spot. Strengthen thyself to sweep,
to clean, and to arrange thy house; for if thou do not
this, thou wilt reject from thy company and from thy
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">225</a></span>
house, and wilt offend much the very clement youth that
is ever walking through our houses, and through our
streets, enjoying and amusing himself&mdash;the youth that
labors, seeking his friends, to comfort them and to comfort
himself with them. To conclude, I tell thee to go and
learn to sweep, and to get rid of the filth and sweepings
of thy house, and to cleanse everything, thyself not the
least. Seek out also a slave to immolate him before God;
make a feast to the principal men, and let them sing
the praises of our Lord. It is moreover fit that thou
shouldst do penance, working a year or more in the house
of God; there thou shalt bleed thyself, and prick thy
body with maguey thorns; and, as a penance for the
adulteries and other vilenesses that thou hast committed,
thou shalt, twice every day, pass osier twigs through
holes pierced in thy body, once through thy tongue, and
once through thine ears. This penance shalt thou do
not alone for the carnalities above mentioned, but also
for the evil and injurious words with which thou hast
insulted and affronted thy neighbors; as also for the
ingratitude thou hast shown with reference to the gifts
bestowed on thee by our Lord, and for thine inhumanity
toward thy neighbors, neither making offerings of the
goods that were given thee by God, nor sharing with
the poor the temporal benefits given by our Lord. Thou
shalt burden thyself to offer paper and copal; thou shalt
give alms to the needy and the hungry, to those that
have nothing to eat nor to drink nor to cover themselves
with; even though thou thyself go without food to give
it away and to clothe the naked: look to it, for their
flesh is like thy flesh, and they are men as thou. Care
most of all for the sick, they are the image of God.<a id="FNanchor_VI-52" href="#Footnote_VI-52" class="fnanchor">[VI-52]</a>
There remains nothing more to be said to thee; go in
peace, and entreat God to aid thee to fulfill what thou
art obliged to do; for he gives favor to all.</p>

<p class="sidenote">PRAYER OF A RULER FOR DIRECTION.</p>

<p>The following prayer is one addressed to Tezcatlipoca
by a recently elected ruler, to give thanks for his election
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">226</a></span>
and to ask favor and light for the proper performance of
his office: O our lord, most clement, invisible and impalpable
protector and governor, well do I know that
thou knowest me, who am a poor man, of low destiny,
born and brought up among filth, and a man of small
reason and mean judgment, full of many defects and
faults, a man that knows not himself, nor considers who
he is. Thou hast bestowed on me a great benefit, favor,
and mercy, without any merit on my part; thou hast
lifted me from the dung-hill and set me in the royal
dignity and throne. Who am I, my Lord, and what is
my worth that thou shouldst put me among the number
of those that thou lovest? among the number of
thine acquaintance, of those thou holdest for chosen
friends and worthy of all honor; born and brought up
for thrones and royal dignities; to this end thou hast
created them able, prudent, descended from noble and
generous fathers; for this end they were created and
educated; to be thine instruments and images they were
born and baptized under the signs and constellations that
lords are born under. They were born to rule thy kingdoms,
thy word being within them and speaking by their
mouth&mdash;according to the desire of the ancient god,
the father of all the gods, the god of fire, who is in the
pond of water among turrets surrounded with stones like
roses, who is called Xiuhtecutli, who determines, examines,
and settles the business and lawsuits of the nation
and of the common people, as it were washing them with
water; in the company and presence of this god the
generous personages aforementioned always are. O
most clement Lord, ruler, and governor, thou hast done
me a great favor. Perhaps it has been through the intercession
and through the tears shed by the departed
lords and ladies that had charge of this kingdom.<a id="FNanchor_VI-53" href="#Footnote_VI-53" class="fnanchor">[VI-53]</a> It
would be great madness to suppose that for any merit
or courage of mine thou hast favored me, setting me
over this your kingdom, the government of which is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">227</a></span>
something very heavy, difficult, and even fearful; it is
as a huge burden, carried on the shoulders, and one that
with great difficulty the past rulers bore, ruling in thy
name. O our Lord, most clement, invisible, and impalpable,
ruler and governor, creator and knower of all
things and thoughts, beautifier of thy creatures,<a id="FNanchor_VI-54" href="#Footnote_VI-54" class="fnanchor">[VI-54]</a> what
shall I say more, poor me? In what wise have I to
rule and govern this thy state, or how have I to
carry this burden of the common people? I who
am blind and deaf, who do not even know myself, nor
know how to rule over myself. I am accustomed to
walk in filth, my faculties fit me for seeking and selling
edible herbs, and for carrying and selling wood. What
I deserve, O Lord, is blindness for mine eyes and
shriveling and rotting for my limbs, and to go dressed
in rags and tatters; this is what I deserve and what
ought to be given me. It is I that need to be ruled and
to be carried on some one's back. Thou hast many
friends and acquaintances that may be trusted with this
load. Since, however, thou has already determined to
set me up for a scoff and a jeer to the world, let thy will
be done and thy word fulfilled. Peradventure thou
knowest not who I am; and, after having known me,
wilt seek another and take the government from me;
taking it again to thyself, hiding again in thyself this
dignity and honor, being already angry and weary of
bearing with me; and thou wilt give the government to
another, to some close friend and acquaintance of thine,
to some one very devout toward thee, that weeps and
sighs and so merits this dignity. Or, peradventure,
this thing that happened to me is a dream, or a
walking in sleep. O Lord, thou that art present
in every place, that knowest all thoughts, that distributest
all gifts, be pleased not to hide from me thy
words and thine inspiration. I do not know the road I
have to follow, nor what I have to do, deign then not
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">228</a></span>
to hide from me the light and the mirror that have to
guide me. Do not allow me to cause those I have to
rule and carry on my shoulders to lose the road and to
wander over rocks and mountains. Do not allow me to
guide them in the tracks of rabbits and deer. Do not
permit, O Lord, any war to be raised against me, nor
any pestilence to come upon those I govern; for I should
not know, in such a case, what to do, nor where to take
those I have upon my shoulders; alas for me, that am
incapable and ignorant. I would not that any sickness
come upon me, for in that case thy nation and people
would be lost, and thy kingdom desolated and given up
to darkness. What shall I do, O Lord and creator, if
by chance I fall into some disgraceful fleshly sin, and
thereby ruin the kingdom? what do if by negligence or
sloth I undo my subjects? what do if through my fault I
hurl down a precipice those I have to rule? Our Lord,
most clement, invisible and impalpable, I entreat thee
not to separate thyself from me; visit me often; visit
this poor house, for I will be waiting for thee therein.
With great thirst I await thee and demand urgently
thy word and inspiration, which thou didst breathe into
thine ancient friends and acquaintances that have ruled
with diligence and rectitude over thy kingdom. This is
thy throne and honor, on either side whereof are seated
thy senators and principal men, who are as thine image
and very person. They give sentence and speak on the
affairs of the state in thy name; thou usest them as
thy flutes, speaking from within them and placing thyself
in their faces and ears, opening their mouths so that
they may speak well. In this place the merchants mock
and jest at our follies, with which merchants thou art
spending thy leisure, since they are thy friends and acquaintances;
there also thou inspirest and breathest upon
thy devoted ones, who weep and sigh in thy presence,
sincerely giving thee their heart.<a id="FNanchor_VI-55" href="#Footnote_VI-55" class="fnanchor">[VI-55]</a> For this reason thou
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">229</a></span>
adornest them with prudence and wisdom, so that they
may look as into a mirror with two faces, where every
one's image is to be seen;<a id="FNanchor_VI-56" href="#Footnote_VI-56" class="fnanchor">[VI-56]</a> for this thou givest them a
very clear axe, without any dimness, whose brightness
flashes into all places. For this cause also thou givest
them gifts and precious jewels, hanging them from their
necks and ears, even like material ornaments such as are
the <i>nacochtl</i>, the <i>tentetl</i>, the <i>tlapiloni</i> or head-tassel, the
<i>matemecatl</i> or tanned strap that lords tie round their
wrists,<a id="FNanchor_VI-57" href="#Footnote_VI-57" class="fnanchor">[VI-57]</a> the yellow leather bound on the ankles, the
beads of gold, and the rich feathers. In this place of
the good governing and rule of thy kingdom, are merited
thy riches and glory, thy sweet and delightful things,
calmness and tranquillity, a peaceable and contented life;
all of which come from thy hand. In the same place,
lastly, are also merited the adverse and wearisome things,
sickness, poverty, and the shortness of life; which things
are sent by thee to those that in this condition do not
fulfill their duty. O our Lord, most clement, knower of
thoughts and giver of gifts, is it in my hand, that am a
mean man, to know how to rule? is the manner of my
life in my hand, and the works that I have to do in my
office? which indeed is of thy kingdom and dignity and
not mine. What thou mayest wish me to do and what
may be thy will and disposition, thou aiding me I will
do. The road thou mayest show me I will walk in;
that thou mayest inspire me with, and put in my
heart, that I will say and speak. O our Lord, most
clement, in thy hand I wholly place myself, for it is not
possible for me to direct or govern myself; I am blind,
darkness, a dung-hill. See good, O Lord, to give me a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">230</a></span>
little light, though it be only as much as a fire-fly gives
out, going about at night; to light me in this dream, in
this life asleep that endures as for a day; where are
many things to stumble at, many things to give occasion
for laughing at one, many things like a rugged road that
has to be gone over by leaps. All this has to happen in
the position thou hast put me in, giving me thy seat and
dignity. O Lord, most clement, I entreat thee to visit
me with thy light, that I may not err, that I may not
undo myself, that my vassals may not cry out against
me. O our Lord, most pitiful, thou hast made me now
the back-piece<a id="FNanchor_VI-58" href="#Footnote_VI-58" class="fnanchor">[VI-58]</a> of thy chair, also thy flute; all without
any merit of mine. I am thy mouth, thy face, thine
ears, thy teeth, and thy nails. Although I am a mean man
I desire to say that I unworthily represent thy person,
and thine image, that the words I shall speak have to
be esteemed as thine, that my face has to be held as
thine, mine eyes as thine, and the punishment that I
shall inflict as if thou hadst inflicted it. For all this
I entreat thee to put thy spirit within me, and thy words,
so that all may obey them and none contradict.<a id="FNanchor_VI-59" href="#Footnote_VI-59" class="fnanchor">[VI-59]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Now with regard to the measure of the genuineness of
the prayers to Tezcatlipoca, just given, it seems evident
that either with or without the conscious connivance of
Father Bernardino de Sahagun, their historian, a certain

ideas has crept into them; it appears to be just as evident,
however, on the other hand, that they contain a
great deal that is original, indigenous, and characteristic
in regard to the Mexican religion. At any rate they

</p>

<p>In the preceding chapter I have given only the loftier
view of Tezcatlipoca's nature, which even on this side
cannot be illustrated without many inconsistencies. We
pass now to relations evidencing a much meaner idea
of his character, and showing him whom we have seen
called invisible, almighty, and beneficent, in a new and
much less imposing light. We pass, in fact, from the
Zeus of Plato and Socrates to the Zeus of Hesiod and
Homer.</p>

<p>Let us glance first at the fashion of his representation in
the temples, though with little hope of seeing the particular
fitness of many of the trappings and symbols with which
his statue was decorated. His principal image, at least
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">238</a></span>
in the city of Mexico, was cut out of a very shining black
stone, called iztli, a variety of obsidian&mdash;a stone valued,
in consideration of its capabilities of cleavage, for making
those long splinters, used as knives by the Aztecs, for
sacrificial and other purposes. For these uses in worship,
and perhaps indeed for its manifold uses in all regards,
it was surnamed <i>teotetl</i>, divine stone. In places
where stone was less convenient the image was made of
wood. The general idea intended to be given was that
of a young man; by which the immortality of the god
was set forth. The ears of the idol were bright with ear-rings
of gold and silver. Through his lower lip was
thrust a little crystal tube, perhaps six inches long, and
through the hollow of this tube a feather was drawn;
sometimes a green feather, sometimes a blue, giving the
transparent ornament the tint at one time of an emerald,
at another of a turquoise. The hair&mdash;carved from
the stone, we may suppose&mdash;was drawn into a queue and
bound with a ribbon of burnished gold, to the end of
which ribbon, hanging down behind, was attached a
golden ear with certain tongues of ascending smoke
painted thereon; which smoke was intended to signify
the prayers of those sinners and afflicted that, commending
themselves to the god, were heard by him. Upon
his head were many plumes of red and green feathers.
From his neck there hung down in front a great jewel of
gold that covered all his breast. Bracelets of gold were
upon his arms, and in his navel was set a precious green
stone. In his left hand there flashed a great circular
mirror of gold, bordered like a fan with precious feathers,
green and azure and yellow; the eyes of the god were
ever fixed on this, for therein he saw reflected all that
was done in the world. This mirror was called <i>itlachia</i>,
that is to say, the 'looker-on,' the 'viewer.' Tezcatlipoca
was sometimes seated on a bench covered with a red
cloth, worked with the likeness of many skulls, having
in his right hand four darts, signifying, according to some,
that he punished sin. To the top of his feet were attached
twenty bells of gold, and to his right foot the fore-foot
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">239</a></span>
of a deer, to show the exceeding swiftness of this
deity in all his ways. Hiding the shining black body,
was a great cloak, curiously wrought in black and white,
adorned with feathers, and fringed about with rosettes of
three colors, red, white, and black. This god, whose
decorations vary a little with different writers&mdash;variations
probably not greater than those really existing
among the different figures representing in different
places the same deity&mdash;had a kind of chapel built
to hold him on the top of his temple. It was
a dark chamber lined with rich cloths of many
colors; and from its obscurity the image looked out,
seated on a pedestal, with a costly canopy immediately
overhead, and an altar in front; not apparently an
altar of sacrifice, but a kind of ornamental table, like a
Christian altar, covered with rich cloth. Into this holy
of holies it was not lawful for any but a priest to enter.</p>

<p class="sidenote">WORSHIP OF TEZCATLIPOCA.</p>

<p>What most of all, however, must have served to bring
the worship of Tezcatlipoca prominently before the people,
were the seats of stone, built at the corners of the streets,
for the accommodation of this god when he walked invisibly
abroad. Mortal, born of woman, never sat thereon;
not the king himself might dare to use them: sacred
they were, sacred for ever, and always shadowed by a
canopy of green boughs, reverently renewed every five
days.<a id="FNanchor_VII-1" href="#Footnote_VII-1" class="fnanchor">[VII-1]</a></p>

<p>Lower and lower we must now descend from the idea
of an almighty god, to take up the thread of various
legends in which Tezcatlipoca figures in an anything but
creditable light. We have already seen him described
as one of those hero-gods whom the new-born Sun was
instrumental in destroying;<a id="FNanchor_VII-2" href="#Footnote_VII-2" class="fnanchor">[VII-2]</a> and we may suppose that
he then ascended into heaven, for we find him afterward
descending thence, letting himself down by a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">240</a></span>
rope twined from spider's web. Rambling through the
world he came to a place called Tulla, where a certain
Quetzalcoatl&mdash;another, according to Sahagun, of the hero-gods
just referred to&mdash;had been ruling for many years.
The two engaged in a game of ball, in the course of
which Tezcatlipoca suddenly transformed himself into a
tiger, occasioning thereby a tremendous panic among the
spectators, many of whom in the haste of their flight
precipitated themselves down a ravine in the neighborhood
into a river and were drowned. Tezcatlipoca then
began to persecute Quetzalcoatl from city to city till he
drove him to Cholula. Here Quetzalcoatl was held as
chief god, and here for some time he was safe. But only
for a few years; his indefatigable and powerful enemy
forced him to retreat with a few of his adherents toward
the sea, to a place called Tlillapa or Tizapan. Here the
hunted Quetzalcoatl died, and his followers inaugurated
the custom of burning the dead by burning his body.<a id="FNanchor_VII-3" href="#Footnote_VII-3" class="fnanchor">[VII-3]</a></p>

<p>The foregoing, from Mendieta, gives us a glimpse, from
one point of view, of that great personage Quetzalcoatl,
of whom we shall know much more anon, and whom in
the meantime we meet again and again as the opponent,
or rather victim of Tezcatlipoca. Let us consider Sahagun's
version of the incidents of this strife:&mdash;</p>

<p class="sidenote">QUETZALCOATL.</p>

<p>Quetzalcoatl was, from very ancient times, adored as a
god in Tulla. He had a very high <i>cu</i><a id="FNanchor_VII-4" href="#Footnote_VII-4" class="fnanchor">[VII-4]</a> there, with many
steps up to it, steps so narrow that there was not room
for a whole foot on any of them. His image was always
in a recumbent position and covered with blankets.
The face of it was very ugly, the head large and furnished
with a long beard. The adherents of this god were
all devoted to the mechanical arts, dexterous in working
the green stone called chalchiuite, and in founding the
precious metals; all of which arts had their beginning and
origin with the said Quetzalcoatl. He had whole houses
made of chalchiuites, others made of silver, others of
white and red shells, others of planks, others of turquoises,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">241</a></span>
and others of rich feathers. His adherents were very
light of foot and swift in going whither they wished,
and they were called <i>tlanquacemilhiyme</i>. There is a
mountain called Tzatzitepetl on which Quetzalcoatl used
to have a crier, and the people afar off and scattered,
and the people of Anáhuac, a hundred leagues distant,
heard and understood at once whatever the said Quetzalcoatl
commanded. And Quetzalcoatl was very rich;
he had all that was needful both to eat and to drink; maize
was abundant, and a head of it was as much as a man could
carry clasped in his arms; pumpkins measured a fathom
round; the stalks of the wild amarinth were so large and
thick that people climbed them like trees. Cotton was
sowed and gathered in of all colors, red, scarlet, yellow, violet,
whitish, green, blue, blackish, grey, orange, and tawny;
these colors in the cotton were natural to it, thus it grew.
Further it is said that in that city of Tulla, there
abounded many sorts of birds of rich and many-colored
plumage, the <i>xiuhtototl</i>, the <i>quetzaltototl</i>, the <i>zaquan</i>, the
<i>tlauquechol</i>, and other birds that sang with much sweetness.
And this Quetzalcoatl had all the riches of the
world, of gold and silver, of green stones called chalchiuites,
and of other precious things, and a great abundance
of cocoa-nut trees of divers colors. The vassals or adherents
of Quetzalcoatl were also very rich and wanted
for nothing; they were never hungry; they never lacked
maize, nor ate the small ears of it, but burned them like
wood to heat the baths. It is said lastly that Quetzalcoatl
did penance by pricking his legs and drawing blood
with the spines of the maguey and by washing at midnight
in a fountain called <i>xicapoya</i>;<a id="FNanchor_VII-5" href="#Footnote_VII-5" class="fnanchor">[VII-5]</a> this custom the
priests and ministers of the Mexican idols adopted.</p>

<p>There came at last a time in which the fortunes of
Quetzalcoatl and of his people, the Toltecs, began to fail;
for there came against them three sorcerers, gods in disguise,
to wit Tezcatlipoca, Huitzilopochtli, and Tlacavepan,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">242</a></span>
who wrought many deceits in Tulla. Tezcatlipoca especially
prepared a cunning trick; he turned himself into a
hoary-headed old man, and went to the house of Quetzalcoatl,
saying to the servants there, I wish to see and
speak to your master. Then the servants said, Go away,
old man, thou canst not see our king, for he is sick, thou
wilt annoy him and cause him heaviness. But Tezcatlipoca
insisted, I must see him. Then the servants bid
the sorcerer to wait, and they went in and told Quetzalcoatl
how an old man without affirmed that he would
see the king and would not be denied. And Quetzalcoatl
answered, Let him come in, behold for many days I
have waited for his coming. So Tezcatlipoca entered,
and he said to the sick god-king, How art thou? adding
further that he had a medicine for him to drink. Then
Quetzalcoatl answered, Thou art welcome, old man, behold
for many days I have waited for thee. And the
old sorcerer spake again, How is thy body, and how art
thou in health? I am exceedingly sick, said Quetzalcoatl,
all my body is in pain, I cannot move my hands nor my
feet. Then, answered Tezcatlipoca, behold this medicine
that I have, it is good and wholesome and intoxicating;
if thou will drink it, thou shalt be intoxicated and healed
and eased at the heart, and thou shalt have in mind the
toils and fatigues of death and of thy departure.<a id="FNanchor_VII-6" href="#Footnote_VII-6" class="fnanchor">[VII-6]</a> Where,
cried Quetzalcoatl, have I to go? To Tullantlapallan, replied
Tezcatlipoca, where there is another old man waiting
for thee; he and thou shall talk together, and on thy
return thence thou shalt be as a youth, yea, as a boy.
And Quetzalcoatl hearing these words his heart was
moved, while the old sorcerer, insisting more and more,
said, Sir, drink this medicine. But the king did not wish
to drink it. The sorcerer, however, insisted, Drink, my
lord, or thou wilt be sorry for it hereafter; at least rub
a little on thy brow and taste a sip. So Quetzalcoatl
tried and tasted it, and drank, saying, What is this? it
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">243</a></span>
seems to be a thing very good and savory; already I
feel myself healed and quit of mine infirmity; already I
am well. Then the old sorcerer said again, Drink once
more, my lord, since it is good; so thou shall be the
more perfectly healed. And Quetzalcoatl drank again,
he made himself drunk, he began to weep sadly, his heart
was eased and moved to depart, he could not rid himself
of the thought that he must go; for this was the snare
and deceit of Tezcatlipoca. And the medicine that Quetzalcoatl
drank was the white wine of the country, made
from the magueys that are called <i>teumetl</i>.</p>

<p class="sidenote">TEZCATLIPOCA AS A PEDDLER.</p>

<p>So Quetzalcoatl, whose fortunes we shall hereafter follow
more particularly, set out upon his journey; and Tezcatlipoca
proceeded further guilefully to kill many Toltecs,
and to ally himself by marriage with Vemac, who was
the temporal lord of the Toltecs, even as Quetzalcoatl was
the spiritual ruler of that people. To accomplish these
things Tezcatlipoca took the appearance of a poor foreigner,
and presented himself naked, as was the custom
of such people, in the market-place of Tulla, selling green
chilly pepper. Now the palace of Vemac, the great king,
overlooked the market-place, and he had an only daughter,
and the girl, looking by chance among the buyers
and sellers, saw the disguised god. She was smitten
through with love of him, and she began to sicken.
Vemac heard of her sickness and he inquired of the
women that guarded her as to what ailed his daughter.
They told him as best they could, how for the love of a
peddler of pepper, named Toveyo, the princess had lain
down to die. The king immediately sent a crier upon
the mountain Tzatzitepec to make this proclamation: O
Toltecs, seek me out Toveyo that goes about selling
green pepper, let him be brought before me. So the
people sought everywhere for the handsome pepper vender;
but he was nowhere to be found. Then, after they
could not find him, he appeared of his own accord one
day, at his old place and trade in the market. He was
brought before the king, who said to him, Where dost
thou belong to? and Toveyo answered, I am a foreigner
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">244</a></span>
come here to sell my green pepper. Why dost thou
delay to cover thyself with breeches and with a blanket?
said Vemac. Toveyo answered that in his country such
things were not in fashion. Vemac continued, My
daughter longs after thee, not willing to be comforted
by any Toltec; she is sick of love and thou must heal
her. But Toveyo replied, This thing can in no wise be,
kill me first; I desire to die, not being worthy to hear
these words, who get my living by selling green pepper.
I tell thee, said the king, that thou must heal my daughter
of this her sickness; fear not. Then they took the
cunning god, and washed him, and cut his hair, and dyed
all his body, and put breeches on him and a blanket;
and the king Vemac said, Get thee in and see my daughter,
there where they guard her. Then the young man
went in and he remained with the princess and she became
sound and well; thus Toveyo became the son-in-law
of the king of Tulla.</p>

<p>Then behold all the Toltecs being filled with jealousy
and offended, spake injurious and insulting words against
king Vemac, saying among themselves, Of all the Toltecs
can there not to be found a man, that this Vemac marries
his daughter to a peddler? Now when the king heard
all the injurious and insulting words that the people
spake against him, he was moved, and he spoke to the
people saying, Come hither, behold I have heard all
these things that ye say against me in the matter of my
son-in-law Toveyo; dissimulate then; take him deceitfully
with you to the war of Cacatepec and Coatepec,
let the enemy kill him there. Having heard these words
the Toltecs armed themselves, and collected a multitude,
and went to the war, bringing Toveyo along. Arrived
where the fighting was to take place, they hid him with
the lame and the dwarfs, charging them, as the custom
was in such cases, to watch for the enemy, while the
soldiers went on to the attack. The battle began; the
Toltecs at once gave way; treacherously and guilefully
deserting Toveyo and the cripples, leaving them to be
slaughtered at their post, they returned to Tulla and told
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">245</a></span>
the king how they had left Toveyo and his companions
alone in the hands of the enemy. When the king heard
the treason he was glad, thinking Toveyo dead, for he
was ashamed of having him for a son-in-law. Affairs
had gone otherwise, however, with Toveyo from what
the plotters supposed. On the approach of the hostile
army he consoled his deformed companions, saying, Fear
nothing; the enemy come against us. but I know that I
shall kill them all. Then he rose up and went forward
against them, against the men of Coatepec and Cacatepec;
he put them to flight and slew of them without number.
When this came to the ears of Vemac, it weighed upon
and terrified him exceedingly. He said to his Toltecs,
Let us now go and receive my son-in-law. So they all
went out with king Vemac to receive Toveyo, bearing
the arms or devises called <i>quetzalapanecayutl</i>, and the
shields called <i>xiuchimali</i>. They gave these things to
Toveyo, and he and his comrades received them with
dancing and the music of flutes, with triumph and rejoicing.
Furthermore, on reaching the palace of the king,
plumes were put upon the heads of the conquerors, and
all the body of each of them was stained yellow, and all
the face red; this was the customary reward of those
that came back victorious from war. And king
Vemac said to his son-in-law, I am now satisfied with
what thou hast done and the Toltecs are satisfied; thou
hast dealt very well with our enemies, rest and take thine
ease. But Toveyo held his peace.</p>

<p class="sidenote">TRIUMPH OF TEZCATLIPOCA.</p>

<p>And after this, Toveyo adorned all his body with the
rich feathers called <i>tocivitl</i>, and commanded the Toltecs
to gather together for a festival, and sent a crier up to
the top of the mountain, Tzatzitepec, to call in the
strangers and the people afar off to dance and to feast.
A numberless multitude gathered to Tulla. When they
were all gathered Toveyo led them out, young men and
girls, to a place called Texcalapa, where he himself began
and led the dancing, playing on a drum. He sang too,
singing each verse to the dancers, who sang it after him,
though they knew not the song before hand. Then was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">246</a></span>
to be seen there a marvelous and terrible thing. From
sunset till midnight the beat of the countless feet grew
faster and faster; the tap, tap, tap of the drum closed
up and poured into a continual roll; the monotonous
song rose higher, wilder, till it burst into a roar. The
multitude became a mob, the revel a riot; the people began
to press upon and hustle each other; the riot became
a panic. There was a fearful gorge or ravine there, with
a river rushing through it called the Texcaltlauhco; a
stone bridge led over the river. Toveyo broke down
this bridge as the people fled; grim corypheus of this
fearful revel, he saw them tread and crush each other
down, under-foot, and over into the abyss. They that
fell were turned into rocks and stones; as for them that
escaped, they did not see nor think that it was Toveyo
and his sorceries had wrought this great destruction;
they were blinded by the witchcraft of the god, and out
of their senses like drunken men.</p>

<p>Far from being satisfied with the slaughter at Texcalapa,
Tezcatlipoca proceeded to hatch further evil against
the Toltecs. He took the appearance of a certain valiant
man called Teguioa, and commanded a crier to summon
all the inhabitants of Tulla and its neighborhood
to come and help at a certain piece of work in a certain
flower-garden (said to have been a garden belonging to
Quetzalcoatl.). All the people gathered to the work,
whereupon the disguised god fell upon them, knocking
them on the head with a <i>coa</i>.<a id="FNanchor_VII-7" href="#Footnote_VII-7" class="fnanchor">[VII-7]</a> Those that escaped the
<i>coa</i> were trodden down and killed by their fellows in
attempting to escape; a countless number was slain; every
man that had come to the work was left lying dead
among the trodden flowers.</p>

<p class="sidenote">TEZCATLIPOCA DEAD.</p>

<p>And after this Tezcatlipoca wrought another witchcraft
against the Toltecs. He called himself Tlacavepan,
or Acexcoch, and came and sat down in the midst
of the market-place of Tulla, having a little manikin (said
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">247</a></span>
to have been Huitzilopochtli) dancing upon his hand.
There was an instant uproar of all the buyers and
sellers and a rush to see the miracle. The people crushed
and trod each other down, so that many were killed there;
and all this happened many times. At last the god-sorcerer
cried out, on one such occasion, What is this?
do you not see that you are befooled by us? stone and
kill us. So the people took up stones and killed the
said sorcerer and his little dancing manikin. But when
the body of the sorcerer had lain in the market-place for
some time it began to stink and to taint the air, and the
wind of it poisoned many. Then the dead sorcerer spake
again, saying, Cast this body outside the town, for many
Toltecs die because of it. So they prepared to cast out the
body, and fastened ropes thereto and pulled. But the
talkative and ill-smelling corpse was so heavy that they
could not move it. Then a crier made a proclamation,
saying, Come all ye Toltecs, and bring ropes with you, that
we may drag out and get rid of this pestilential carcass.
All came accordingly, bringing ropes, and the ropes were
fastened to the body, and all pulled. It was utterly in
vain. Rope after rope broke with a sudden snap, and
those that dragged on a rope fell and were killed when it
broke. Then the dead wizard looked up and said, O
Toltecs, a verse of a song is needed; and he himself gave
them a verse. They repeated the verse after him, and,
singing it, pulled all together, so that with shouts they
hauled the body out of the city; though still not without
many ropes breaking and many persons being killed as
before. All this being over, those Toltecs that remained
unhurt returned every man to his place, not remembering
anything of what had happened, for they were all as
drunken.</p>

<p>Other signs and wonders were wrought by Tezcatlipoca
in his rôle of sorcerer. A white bird called Yztaccuixtli,
was clearly seen flying over Tulla, transfixed
with a dart. At night also, the sierra called Zacatepec
burned, and the flames were seen from far. All the
people were stirred up and affrighted, saying one to another,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">248</a></span>
O Toltecs, it is all over with us now; the time of
the end of Tulla is come; alas for us, whither shall we
go?</p>

<p>Then Tezcatlipoca wrought another evil upon the Toltecs:
he rained down stones upon them. There fell also,
at the same time, a great stone from heaven called <i>techcatl</i>;
and when it fell the god-sorcerer took the appearance
of an old woman, and went about selling little banners
in a place called Chapultepecuitlapilco, otherwise
named Vetzinco. Many then became mad and bought
of these banners and went to the place where was the
stone Techcatl, and there got themselves killed; and no
one was found to say so much as, What is this that happens
to us? they were all mad.</p>

<p>Another woe Tezcatlipoca brought upon the Toltecs.
All their victuals suddenly became sour, and no one was
able to eat of them. The old woman, above mentioned,
took up then her abode in a place called Xochitla<a id="FNanchor_VII-8" href="#Footnote_VII-8" class="fnanchor">[VII-8]</a>, and
began to roast maize; and the odor of the roasted maize
reached all the cities round about. The starving people
set out immediately, and with one accord, to go where the
old woman was. They reached her instantly, for here it
may be again said, that the Toltecs were exceedingly
light of foot, and arrived always immediately whithersoever
they wished to go. As for the Toltecs that gathered
to the sham sorceress, not one of them escaped, she killed
them every one.<a id="FNanchor_VII-9" href="#Footnote_VII-9" class="fnanchor">[VII-9]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">IMAGE OF QUETZALCOATL.</p>

<p>Turning, without remark for the present, from Tezcatlipoca,
of whose life on earth the preceding farrago of
legends is all that is known, let us take up the same
period in the history of Quetzalcoatl. The city of Cholula
was the place in which this god was most honored,
and towards which he was supposed to be most favorably
inclined; Cholula being greatly given to commerce and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">249</a></span>
handicraft, and the Cholulans considering Quetzalcoatl
to be the god of merchandise. As Acosta tells: "In
Cholula, which is a commonwealth of Mexico, they
worshipt a famous idoll which was the god of marchandise,
being to this day greatly given to trafficke. They
called it Quetzaalcoalt. This idoll was in a great place in
a temple very hie: it had about it, golde, silver, jewells,
very rich feathers, and habites of divers colours. It
had the forme of a man, but the visage of a little bird,
with a red bill, and above a combe full of wartes, having
ranckes of teeth, and the tongue hanging out. It
carried vpon the head, a pointed myter of painted paper,
a sithe in the hand, and many toyes of golde on the legges;
with a thousand other foolish inventions, whereof all
had their significations, and they worshipt it, for that hee
enriched whome hee pleased, as Memnon and Plutus. In
trueth this name which the Choluanos gave to their god,
was very fitte, although they vnderstood it not: they
called it Quetzaalcoalt, signifying colour of a rich feather,
for such is the divell of covetousnesse."<a id="FNanchor_VII-10" href="#Footnote_VII-10" class="fnanchor">[VII-10]</a></p>

<p>Motolinia gives the following confused account of the
birth as a man, the life, and the apotheosis of this god.
The Mexican Adam, called Iztacmixcoatl by some writers,
married a second time.<a id="FNanchor_VII-11" href="#Footnote_VII-11" class="fnanchor">[VII-11]</a> This second wife, Chimamatl
by name, bore him, it is said, an only son who was
called Quetzalcoatl. This son grew up a chaste and temperate
man. He originated by his preaching and practice
the custom of fasting and self-punishment; and from
that time many in that country began to do this penance.
He never married, nor knew any woman, but lived
restrainedly and chastely all his days. The custom of
sacrificing the ears and the tongue, by drawing blood
from these members, was also introduced by him; not
for the service of the devil but in penitence for the sins
of his speech and his hearing: it is true that afterward
the demon misappropriated these rites to his own use
and worship. A man called Chichimecatl fastened a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">250</a></span>
leather strap on the arm of Quetzalcoatl, fixing it high
up near the shoulder; Chichimecatl was from that time
called Acolhuatl, and from him, it is said, are descended
those of Colhua, ancestors of Montezuma and lords of
Mexico and Coluacan. This Quetzalcoatl is now held
as a deity and called the god of the air; everywhere an
infinite number of temples has been raised to him, and
everywhere his statue or picture is found.<a id="FNanchor_VII-12" href="#Footnote_VII-12" class="fnanchor">[VII-12]</a></p>

<p>According to the account of Mendieta, tradition varied
much as to the facts of the life of Quetzalcoatl. Some
said he was the son of Camaxtli, god of hunting and
fishing, and of Camaxtli's wife Chimalma. Others make
mention only of the name of Chimalma, saying that as she
was sweeping one day she found a small green stone
called chalchiuite, that she picked it up, became miraculously
pregnant, and gave birth to the said Quetzalcoatl.
This god was worshiped as a principal deity in Cholula,
where, as well as in Tlaxcala and Huejotzingo, there
were many of his temples. We have already had one
legend from Mendieta,<a id="FNanchor_VII-13" href="#Footnote_VII-13" class="fnanchor">[VII-13]</a> giving an account of the expulsion
from Tulla and death of Quetzalcoatl; the following
from the same source gives a different and more usual
version of the said expulsion:&mdash;</p>

<p class="sidenote">DEPARTURE OF QUETZALCOATL.</p>

<p>Quetzalcoatl came from the parts of Yucatan (although
some said from Tulla) to the city of Cholula. He was
a white man, of portly person, broad brow, great eyes,
long black hair, and large round beard; of exceedingly
chaste and quiet life, and of great moderation in all
things. The people had at least three reasons for the
great love, reverence, and devotion with which they regarded
him: first, he taught the silversmith's art, a craft
the Cholulans greatly prided themselves on; second, he
desired no sacrifice of the blood of men or animals, but
delighted only in offerings of bread, roses and other
flowers, of perfumes and sweet odors; third, he prohibited
and forbade all war and violence. Nor were
these qualities esteemed only in the city of his chiefest
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">251</a></span>
labors and teachings; from all the land came pilgrims
and devotees to the shrine of the gentle god. Even
the enemies of Cholula came and went secure, in fulfilling
their vows; and the lords of distant lands had in
Cholula their chapels and idols to the common object of
devotion and esteem. And only Quetzalcoatl among all
the gods was preëminently called Lord; in such sort, that
when any one swore, saying, By Our Lord, he meant
Quetzalcoatl and no other; though there were many
other highly esteemed gods. For indeed the service of
this god was gentle, neither did he demand hard things,
but light; and he taught only virtue, abhorring all evil
and hurt. Twenty years this good deity remained in
Cholula, then he passed away by the road he had come,
carrying with him four of the principal and most virtuous
youths of that city. He journeyed for a hundred
and fifty leagues, till he came to the sea, in a distant
province called Goatzacoalco. Here he took leave of
his companions and sent them back to their city, instructing
them to tell their fellow citizens that a day
should come in which white men would land upon their
coasts, by way of the sea in which the sun rises;
brethren of his and having beards like his; and that
they should rule that land. The Mexicans always waited
for the accomplishment of this prophecy, and when the
Spaniards came they took them for the descendants of
their meek and gentle prophet, although, as Mendieta remarks
with some sarcasm, when they came to know them
and to experience their works, they thought otherwise.</p>

<p>Quetzalcoatl is further reported by Mendieta to have
assisted in drawing up and arranging the Mexican Calendar,
a sacred book of thirteen tables, in which the religious
rites and ceremonies proper to each day were set
forth, in connection with the appropriate signs. It is
said that the gods having created mankind, bethought
themselves that it would be well if the people they had
made had some writings by which they might direct
themselves. Now there were, in a certain cave at Cuernavaca,
two personages of the number of the gods, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">252</a></span>
they were man and wife, he Oxomoco and she Cipactonal;
and they were consulting together. It appeared
good to the old woman that her descendant Quetzalcoatl
should be consulted. The Cholulan god thought
the thing of the calendar to be good and reasonable; so
the three set to work. To the old woman was respectfully
allotted the privilege of choosing and writing the
first sign; she painted a kind of water-serpent called
<i>cipactli</i>, and called the sign <i>Ce Cipactli</i>, that is "a serpent."
Oxomoco, in his turn wrote "two canes," and
then Quetzalcoatl wrote "three houses;" and so they
went on till the whole thirteen signs of each table were
written out in their order.<a id="FNanchor_VII-14" href="#Footnote_VII-14" class="fnanchor">[VII-14]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE SUN CALLS QUETZALCOATL.</p>

<p>Let us now take up again the narrative of Sahagun, at
the point where Quetzalcoatl, after drinking the potion
prepared by Tezcatlipoca, prepares to set off upon his
journey. Quetzalcoatl, very heavy in heart for all the
misfortunes that this rival god was bringing upon the
Toltecs, burned his beautiful houses of silver and of shell,
and ordered other precious things to be buried in the
mountains and ravines. He turned the cocoa-nut trees
into a kind of trees that are called <i>mizquitl</i>; he commanded
all the birds of rich plumage, the quetzaltototl,
and the xiuhtotl, and the tlauquechol, to fly away and
go into Anáhuac, a hundred leagues distant. Then he
himself set out upon his road from Tulla; he traveled on
till he came to a place called Quauhtitlan, where was a
great tree, high and very thick. Here the exile rested,
and he asked his servants for a mirror, and looked
at his own face. What thoughts soever were working
in his heart, he only said, I am already old. Then he
named that place Vevequauhtitlan, and he took up stones
and stoned the great tree; and all the stones he threw
sank into it, and were for a long time to be seen sticking
there, from the ground even up to the topmost branches.
Continuing his journey, having flute-players playing
before him, he came to a place on the road where he
was weary and sat down on a stone to rest. And looking
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">253</a></span>
toward Tulla, he wept bitterly. His tears marked and
ate into the stone on which he sat, and the print of his
hands, and of his back parts, was also found therein
when he resumed his journey. He called that place
Temacpalco. After that he reached a very great and
wide river, and he commanded a stone bridge to be
thrown across it; on that bridge he crossed the river,
and he named the place Tepanoaya. Going on upon
his way, Quetzalcoatl came to another place, where certain
sorcerers met and tried to stop him, saying, Whither
goest thou? why dost thou leave thy city? to whose care
wilt thou commend it? who will do penance? Quetzalcoatl
replied to the said sorcerers, Ye can in no wise hinder
my going, for I must go. They asked him further,
Whither goest thou? He said, To Tlapalla. They continued,
But to what end goest thou? He said, I am
called and the sun calls me. So the sorcerers said, Go
then, but leave behind all the mechanical arts, the melting
of silver, the working of precious stones and of masonry,
the painting, feather-working, and other crafts.
And of all these the sorcerers despoiled Quetzalcoatl. As
for him, he cast into a fountain all the rich jewels that
he had with him; and that fountain was called Cohcaapa,
and it is so named to this day.</p>

<p>Quetzalcoatl continued his journey; and there came
another sorcerer to meet him, saying, Whither goest thou?
Quetzalcoatl said, To Tlapalla. The wizard said, Very
well; but drink this wine that I have. The traveler
answered, No: I cannot drink it; I cannot so much as
taste it. Thou must drink, said the grim magician, were
it but a drop; for to none of the living can I give it; it
intoxicates all, so drink. Then Quetzalcoatl took the
wine and drank it through a cane. Drinking, he made
himself drunk; he slept upon the road; he began to snore;
and when he awoke, he looked on one side and on the
other, and tore his hair with his hands. And that place
was called Cochtoca.</p>

<p>Quetzalcoatl going on upon his way and passing between
the sierra of the volcano and the snowy sierra, all
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">254</a></span>
his servants, being hump-backed and dwarfs, died of cold
in the pass between the said mountains. And Quetzalcoatl
bewailed their death bitterly and sang with
weeping and sighing. Then he saw the other snowy
sierra, which is called Poyauhtecatl and is near Tecamachalco;
and so he passed by all the cities and places,
leaving many signs, it is said, in all the mountains and
roads.<a id="FNanchor_VII-15" href="#Footnote_VII-15" class="fnanchor">[VII-15]</a> It is said further that he had a way of crossing
the sierras whereby he amused and rested himself at the
same time: when he came to the top of a mountain he
used to sit down, and so seated, let himself slide down
the mountain-side to the bottom. In one place he built
a court for ball-play, all of squared stone, and here he
used to play the game called <i>tlachtli</i>.<a id="FNanchor_VII-16" href="#Footnote_VII-16" class="fnanchor">[VII-16]</a> Through the midst
of this court he drew a line called the <i>telcotl</i>; and where
that line was made the mountain is now opened with a
deep gash. In another place he cast a dart at a great
tree called a <i>pochutl</i>, piercing it through with the dart
in such wise that the tree looked like a cross; for the
dart he threw was itself a tree of the same kind.<a id="FNanchor_VII-17" href="#Footnote_VII-17" class="fnanchor">[VII-17]</a> Some
say that Quetzalcoatl built certain subterranean houses,
called <i>mictlancalco</i>; and further, that he set up and balanced
a great stone, so that one could move it with one's
little finger, yet a multitude could not displace it. Many
other notable things remain that Quetzalcoatl did among
many peoples; he it was that named all the places and
woods and mountains. Traveling ever onward, he came
at last to the sea-shore, and there commanded a raft to
be made of the snakes called <i>coatlapechtli</i>. Having seated
himself on this raft as in a canoe, he put out to sea, and
no man knows how he got to Tlapallan.<a id="FNanchor_VII-18" href="#Footnote_VII-18" class="fnanchor">[VII-18]</a></p>

<p>Torquemada gives a long and valuable account of
Quetzalcoatl, gathered from many sources, which cannot
be overlooked. It runs much as follows:&mdash;The name
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">255</a></span>
Quetzalcoatl means Snake-plumage, or Snake that has
plumage&mdash;and the kind of snake referred to in this
name, is found in the province of Xicalanco, which is
on the frontier of the kingdom of Yucatan as one goes
thence to Tabasco. This god Quetzalcoatl was very celebrated
among the people of the city of Cholula, and held
in that place for the greatest of all. He was, according
to credible histories, high priest in the city of Tulla.
From that place he went to Cholula, and not, as Bishop
Bartolomé de las Casas says in his <i>Apologia</i>, to Yucatan;
though he went to Yucatan afterwards, as we shall see.
It is said of Quetzalcoatl that he was a white man, large
bodied, broad-browed, great-eyed, with long black hair,
and a beard heavy and rounded.<a id="FNanchor_VII-19" href="#Footnote_VII-19" class="fnanchor">[VII-19]</a> He was a great artificer,
and very ingenious. He taught many mechanical
arts, especially the art of working the precious stones
called chalchiuites, which are a kind of green stone
highly valued, and the art of casting silver and gold.
The people, seeing him so inventive, held him in great
estimation, and reverenced him as king in that city; and
so it came about that, though in temporal things the
ruler of Tulla was a lord named Huemac,<a id="FNanchor_VII-20" href="#Footnote_VII-20" class="fnanchor">[VII-20]</a> yet in all
spiritual and ecclesiastical matters Quetzalcoatl was supreme,
and as it were chief pontiff.</p>

<p class="sidenote">SWIFTNESS OF THE SERVANTS OF QUETZALCOATL.</p>

<p>It is feigned by those that seek to make much of their
god that he had certain palaces made of green stone like
emeralds, others made of silver, others of shells, red and
white, others of all kinds of wood, others of turquoise,
and others of precious feathers. He is said to have been
very rich, and in need of nothing. His vassals were
very obedient to him, and very light of foot; they were
called tlanquacemilhuique. When they wished to publish
any command of Quetzalcoatl, they sent a crier up
upon a high mountain called Tzatzitepec, where with a
loud voice he proclaimed the order; and the voice of
this crier was heard for a hundred leagues distance, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">256</a></span>
farther, even to the coasts of the sea: all this is affirmed
for true. The fruits of the earth and the trees flourished
there in an extraordinary degree, and sweet singing birds
were abundant. The great pontiff inaugurated a system
of penance, pricking his legs, and drawing blood and
staining therewith maguey thorns. He washed also at
midnight in a fountain called Xiuhpacoya. From all
this, it is said, the idolatrous priests of Mexico adopted
their similar custom.</p>

<p class="sidenote">QUETZALCOATL LEAVES MARKS ON A STONE.</p>

<p>While Quetzalcoatl was enjoying this good fortune with
pomp and majesty, we are told that a great magician
called Titlacahua [Tezcatlipoca], another of the gods,
arrived at Tulla. He took the form of an old man, and
went in to see Quetzalcoatl, saying to him, My lord, inasmuch
as I know thine intent and how much thou
desirest to set out for certain distant lands, also, because
I know from thy servants that thou art unwell, I have
brought thee a certain beverage, by drinking which thou
shalt attain thine end. Thou shalt so make thy way to
the country thou desirest, having perfect health to make
the journey; neither shalt thou remember at all the
fatigues and toils of life, nor how thou art mortal.<a id="FNanchor_VII-21" href="#Footnote_VII-21" class="fnanchor">[VII-21]</a>
Seeing all his projects thus discovered by the pretended
old man, Quetzalcoatl questioned him, Where have I to
go. Tezcatlipoca answered, That it was already determined
with the supreme gods, that he had to go to Tlapalla,
and that the thing was inevitable, because there
was another old man waiting for him at his destination.
As Quetzalcoatl heard this, he said that it was true, and
that he desired it much; and he took the vessel and
drank the liquor it contained. Quetzalcoatl was thus
easily persuaded to what Tezcatlipoca desired, because
he wished to make himself immortal and to enjoy perpetual
life. Having swallowed the draught he became
beside himself, and out of his mind, weeping sadly and
bitterly. He determined to go to Tlapalla. He destroyed
or buried all his plate and other property and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">257</a></span>
set out. First he arrived at the place, Quauhtitlan,
where the great tree was and where he, borrowing a
mirror from his servants, found himself "already old."
The name of this place was changed by him to Huehuequauhtitlan,
that is to say, "near the old tree, or the
tree of the old man;" and the trunk of the tree was filled
with stones that he cast at it. After that he journeyed
on, his people playing flutes and other instruments, till
he came to a mountain near the city of Tlalnepantla,
two leagues from the city of Mexico, where he sat down on
a stone and put his hands on it, leaving marks embedded
therein that may be seen to this day. The truth of this
thing is strongly corroborated by the inhabitants of that
district; I myself have questioned them upon the subject,
and it has been certified to me. Furthermore we
have it written down accurately by many worthy authors;
and the name of the locality is now Temacpalco, that is
to say "in the palm of the hand."</p>

<p>Journeying on to the coast and to the kingdom of Tlapalla,
Quetzalcoatl was met by the three sorcerers, Tezcatlipoca
and other two with him, who had already
brought so much destruction upon Tulla. These tried
to stop or hinder him in his journey, questioning him,
Whither goest thou? He answered, To Tlapalla. To
whom, they inquired, hast thou given the charge of thy
kingdom of Tulla, and who will do penance there? But
he said that that was no longer any affair of his and that
he must pursue his road. And being further questioned
as to the object of his journey, he said that he was called
by the lord of the land to which he was going, who was
the sun.<a id="FNanchor_VII-22" href="#Footnote_VII-22" class="fnanchor">[VII-22]</a> The three wizards seeing then the determination
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">258</a></span>
of Quetzalcoatl, made no further attempt to dissuade
him from his purpose, but contented themselves
with taking from him all his instruments and his
mechanical arts, so that though he departed those
things should not be wanting to the state. It was here
that Quetzalcoatl threw into a fountain all the rich
jewels that he carried with him; for which thing the
fountain was called from that time Cozcaapan, that is to
say, "The water of the strings or chains of jewels."
The same place is now called Coaapan, that is to say,
"In the snake-water," and very properly, because the
word Quetzalcoatl means "feathered snake." In this
way he journeyed on, suffering various molestations
from those sorcerers, his enemies, till he arrived at
Cholula where he was received (as we in another part
say),<a id="FNanchor_VII-23" href="#Footnote_VII-23" class="fnanchor">[VII-23]</a> and afterward adored as god. Having lived
twenty years in that city he was expelled by Tezcatlipoca.
He set out for the kingdom of Tlapalla, accompanied
by four virtuous youths of noble birth, and in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">259</a></span>
Goatzacoalco, a province distant from Cholula toward
the sea a hundred and fifty leagues, he embarked for his
destination. Parting with his disciples, he told them
that there should surely come to them in after times, by
way of the sea where the sun rises, certain white men
with white beards, like him, and that these would be his
brothers and would rule that land.</p>

<p>After that the four disciples returned to Cholula, and
told all that their master and god had prophesied when
departing. Then the Cholulans divided their province
into four principalities and gave the government to those
four, and some four of their descendants always ruled
in like manner over these tetrarchies till the Spaniard
came; being, however, subordinate to a central power.</p>

<p class="sidenote">QUETZALCOATL SWEPT THE ROADS.</p>

<p>This Quetzalcoatl was god of the air, and as such had
his temple, of a round shape and very magnificent.
He was made god of the air for the mildness and gentleness
of all his ways, not liking the sharp and harsh
measures to which the other gods were so strongly inclined.
It is to be said further that his life on earth
was marked by intensely religious characteristics; not
only was he devoted to the careful observance of all the
old customary forms of worship, but he himself ordained
and appointed many new rites, ceremonies, and festivals
for the adoration of the gods; and it is held for certain
that he made the calendar. He had priests who were
called quequetzalcohua, that is to say "priests of the
order of Quetzalcoatl." The memory of him was engraved
deeply upon the minds of the people, and it is
said that when barren women prayed and made sacrifices
to him, children were given them. He was, as
we have said, god of the winds, and the power of causing
them to blow was attributed to him as well as the power
of calming or causing their fury to cease. It was said
further that he swept the road, so that the gods called
Tlaloques could rain: this the people imagined because
ordinarily a month or more before the rains began there
blew strong winds throughout all New Spain. Quetzalcoatl
is described as having worn during life, for the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">260</a></span>
sake of modesty, garments that reached down to the
feet, with a blanket over all, sown with red crosses.
The Cholulans preserved certain green stones that had
belonged to him, regarding them with great veneration
and esteeming them as relics. Upon one of these was
carved a monkey's head, very natural. In the city of
Cholula there was to be found dedicated to him a great
and magnificent temple, with many steps, but each step
so narrow that there was not room for a foot on it. His
image had a very ugly face, with a large and heavily
bearded head. It was not set on its feet but lying
down, and covered with blankets. This, it is said, was
done as a memorial that he would one day return to
reign. For reverence of his great majesty, his image
was kept covered, and to signify his absence it was kept
lying down, as one that sleeps, as one that lies down to
sleep. In awaking from that sleep, he was to rise up
and reign. The people also of Yucatan reverenced this
god Quetzalcoatl, calling him Kukulcan, and saying that
he came to them from the west, that is from New Spain,
for Yucatan is eastward therefrom. From him it is said
the kings of Yucatan are descended, who call themselves
Cocomes, that is to say "judges or hearers."<a id="FNanchor_VII-24" href="#Footnote_VII-24" class="fnanchor">[VII-24]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">CLAVIGERO ON QUETZALCOATL.</p>

<p>Clavigero's account is characteristically clear and comprehensible.
It may be summed up as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Among the Mexicans and other nations of Anáhuac,
Quetzalcoatl was accounted god of the air. He is said
to have been sometime high-priest of Tulla. He is described
as having been white&mdash;a large, broad-browed,
great-eyed man, with long black hair and thick beard.
His life was rigidly temperate and exemplary, and his
industry was directed by the profoundest wisdom. He
amassed great treasure, and his was the invention of
gem-cutting and of metal-casting. All things prospered
in his time. One ear of corn was a man's load; and
the gourds, or pumpkins, of the day were as tall as one's
body. No one dyed cotton then, for it grew of all colors;
and all other things in like manner were perfect and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">261</a></span>
abundant. The very birds in the trees sang such songs
as have never since been heard, and flashed such marvelous
beauties in the sun as no plumage of later times
could rival. Quetzalcoatl had his laws proclaimed from
the top of the hill Tzatzitepec, (mountain of outcry),
near Tulla, by a crier whose voice was audible for three
hundred miles.</p>

<p>All this, however, was put an end to, as far as Tulla
was concerned, by Tezcatlipoca, who, moved perhaps by
jealousy, determined to remove Quetzalcoatl. So the
god appeared to the great teacher in the guise of an old
man, telling him it was the will of the gods that he betake
himself to Tlapalla, and administering at the same
time a potion, the effect of which was to cause an intense
longing for the said journey. Quetzalcoatl set out
and, having performed many marvels on the way, arrived
in Cholula. Here the inhabitants would not suffer him
to go farther, but persuaded him to accept the government
of their city; and he remained with them, teaching
many useful arts, customs, and ceremonies and preaching
against war and all other forms of cruelty. According
to some, he at this time arranged the divisions of
the seasons and the calendar.</p>

<p>Having lived twenty years in Cholula, he left, still
impelled by the subtle draught, to seek this imaginary
city of Tlapalla. He was no more seen of men, some
said one thing and some another; but, however he
might have disappeared, he was apotheosized by the
Toltecs of Cholula, who raised him a great mound and
built a sanctuary upon it. A similar structure was
erected to his honor at Tulla. From Cholula his worship
as god of the air spread over all the country; in
Yucatan the nobles claimed descent from him.<a id="FNanchor_VII-25" href="#Footnote_VII-25" class="fnanchor">[VII-25]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">BRASSEUR ON QUETZALCOATL.</p>

<p>The ideas of Brasseur with regard to Quetzalcoatl have
their roots in and must be traced back to the very first
appearing of the Mexican religion, or of the religion or
religions by which it was preceded; so that to arrive at
those ideas I must give a summary of the abbé's whole
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">262</a></span>
theory of the origin of that creed. He believes that in
the seething and thundering of volcanoes a conception
of divinity and of supernatural powers first sprang up in
the mind of the ancestors of the Mexicans. The volcanoes
were afterwards identified with the stars, and the
most terrific of all, Nanahuatl or Nanahuatzin,<a id="FNanchor_VII-26" href="#Footnote_VII-26" class="fnanchor">[VII-26]</a> received
the honors of apotheosis in the sun. Issued from the
earth of the Crescent (Brasseur's sunken island or continent
in the Atlantic),<a id="FNanchor_VII-27" href="#Footnote_VII-27" class="fnanchor">[VII-27]</a> personified in the antique
Quetzalcoatl, prototype of priests and of sacerdotal continence,
he is thus his son and identifies himself with
him; he (the divinity, Tylor's "Great Somebody") is
the model of sages under the name of Hueman and
the prototype of kings under that of Topiltzin. Strange
thing to find united in one being, personalities so diverse!
King, philosopher, priest par excellence, whose virtues
serve as a rule to all the priests of the pagan antiquity,
and, side by side with all that, incontinence and passion
deified in this invalid, whose name even, "the syphilitic,"
is the expression of the abuse he has made of the
sex.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the religion two sects appear
to have sprung up, or rather two manners of judging the
same events. There was first a struggle, and then a
separation; under the banner-names of Quetzalcoatl and
Tezcatlipoca the rival schools fought for the most part&mdash;of
course there were divers minor factions; but the
foregoing were the principal and most important. There
is every reason to believe that the religion that took
Quetzalcoatl for symbol was but a reformation upon
another more ancient, that had the moon for its object.
It is the moon, male and female, <i>Luna Lunus</i>, personified
in the earth of the Crescent, engulfed in the abyss,
that I believe (it is always the abbé that speaks) I see
at the commencement of the amalgam of rites and symbols
of every kind, religion of enjoyments and material
pleasures, born of the promiscuity of the men and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">263</a></span>
women, taken refuge in the lesser Antilles after the cataclysm.</p>

<p>The religion that had taken the moon for point of
departure, and in which women seem to have played the
principal rôle, as priestesses, attacked formally, by this
very fact, a more antique religion, a pre-diluvian religion
that appears to have been Sabaism, entirely exempt
from idolatry, and in which the sun received the chief
homage. In the new religion, on the contrary, it was
not the moon as a star, which was the real object of
worship, it was the moon-land (lune-terre), it was the
region of the Crescent, shrouded under the waves, whose
death was wept and whose resurrection was afterward
celebrated in the appearance of the isles&mdash;refuge of the
shipwrecked of the grand catastrophe&mdash;of the Lesser
Antilles; to the number of seven principal islands, sung,
in all American legends, as the Seven Grottoes, cradle of
nations.</p>

<p>This is the myth of Quetzalcoatl, who dies or disappears,
and whose personality is represented at the
outset in the isles, then successively, in all the countries
whither the civilization was carried of which he
was the flag. So far as I can judge at present, the priest
who placed himself under the ægis of this grand name,
labored solely to reform what there was of odious and
barbarous in the cult of which the women had the chief
direction, and under whose regime human blood flowed
in waves. After the triumph of Quetzalcoatl, the men
who bore his name took the direction of religion and
society, which then made considerable progress in their
hands.</p>

<p>But if we are to believe the same traditions, their preponderance
had not a very long duration. The most
restless and the most audacious among the partisans of
the ancient order of things, raised the flag of revolt:
they became the chiefs of a warlike faction, rival of the
sacerdotal&mdash;a conquering faction, source of veritable
royal dynasties and of the religion of the sun living and
victorious, in opposition to the god entombed in the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">264</a></span>
abyss. Quetzalcoatl, vanquished by Tezcatlipoca, then
retired before a too-powerful enemy, and the Toltecs
were dispersed among all nations. Those of them that
remained coalesced with the victors, and from the accord
of the aforementioned three cults, there sprang that
monstrous amalgam of so many different ideas and symbols,
such as is found to-day in what remains to us of the
Mexican religion.</p>

<p>For me (and it is always the abbé that speaks), I believe
I perceive the origin of the struggle, not alone in
the diversity of races, but principally in the existence of
two currents of contrary ideas, having had the same point
of departure in the events of the great cataclysm of the
Crescent Land, above referred to. Different manners of
looking at these events and of commemorating them, seem
to me to have marked from the beginning the starting
point of two religions that lived, perhaps, side by side
for centuries without the explosion of their disagreements,
otherwise than by insignificant agitations. Before
these two could take, with regard to each other, the proportions
of a schism or a heresy, it was necessary that
all the materials of which these religions are constituted
had had time to elaborate themselves, and that the
hieroglyphics which represented their origin had become
sufficiently obscure for the priesthood to keep the vulgar
from understanding them. For, if schism has brought
on the struggle between and afterward the violent separation
of families, this separation can not have taken
place till after the entire creation of myths, the entire
construction of these divine genealogies, of these poetic
traditions, that are found scattered among all the peoples
of the earth, but of which the complete whole does not
exist, save in the history and religion of Mexico.<a id="FNanchor_VII-28" href="#Footnote_VII-28" class="fnanchor">[VII-28]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">MANY CHARACTERS OF QUETZALCOATL.</p>

<p>Two orders of gods&mdash;the one order fallen from heaven
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">265</a></span>
into the abyss, becoming there the judges of the dead,
and being personified in one of their number, who came
to life again, symbolizing thus life and death&mdash;the other
order surviving the cataclysm and symbolizing thus an
imperishable life&mdash;such, at its origin, is the double
character of the myth of Quetzalcoatl. But, in reality,
this god he is the earth, he is the region swallowed up
by the waters, he is the vanquished stifled under the
weight of his adversary, under the force of the victorious
wave; which adversary, which power in opposition to the
first, joining itself to the fire on the blazing pile of Nanahuatl,
is Tezcatlipoca, is Hercules, conqueror of enemies,
is the god whose struggle is eternal as that of the
ocean beating the shore, is he in whom the light becomes
afterward personified, and who becomes thus the battle-flag
of the opponents of Quetzalcoatl. To the dead god
a victim is necessary, one that like him descends into
the abyss. This victim was a young girl, chosen among
those that were consecrated at the foot of the pyramid,
and drowned; a custom long found as well in Egypt as
at Chichen-Itza,<a id="FNanchor_VII-29" href="#Footnote_VII-29" class="fnanchor">[VII-29]</a> and in many other countries of the
world. But to the god come to life again, to the god in
whom fire was personified, and immortal life, to Quetzalcoatl
when he became Huitzilopochtli, victims were
sacrificed, by tearing out the heart&mdash;symbol of the jet
of flame issuing from the volcano&mdash;to offer it to the conquering
sun, symbol of Tezcatlipoca, who first demanded
holocausts of human blood.<a id="FNanchor_VII-30" href="#Footnote_VII-30" class="fnanchor">[VII-30]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">266</a></span></p>

<p>Mr Tylor declares Quetzalcoatl to have been the Sun:
"We may even find him identified with the Sun by
name, and his history is perhaps a more compact and
perfect series of solar myths than hangs to the name of
any single personage in our own Aryan mythology.
His mother, the Dawn or the Night, gives birth to him,
and dies. His father Camaxtli is the sun, and was worshiped
with solar rites in Mexico, but he is the old Sun
of yesterday. The clouds, personified in the mythic
race of the Mixcohuas, or "Cloud-Snakes" (the Nibelungs
of the western hemisphere), bear down the old Sun
and choke him, and bury him in their mountain. But
the young Quetzalcoatl, the Sun of to-day, rushes up into
the midst of them from below, and some he slays at
the first onset, and some he leaves, rift with red wounds
to die. We have the Sun boat of Helios, of the Egyptian
Ra, of the Polynesian Maui. Quetzalcoatl, his
bright career drawing toward its close, is chased into
far lands by his kinsman Tezcatlipoca, the young Sun
of to-morrow. He, too, is well known as a Sun God in
the Mexican theology. Wonderfully fitting with all
this, one incident after another in the life of Quetzalcoatl
falls into its place. The guardians of the sacred
fire tend him, his funeral pile is on the top of Orizaba,
he is the helper of travelers, the maker of the calendar,
the source of astrology, the beginner of history, the
bringer of wealth and happiness. He is the patron of
the craftsmen, whom he lights to his labor; as it is
written in an ancient Sanskrit hymn, 'He steps forth,
the splendor of the sky, the wide-seeing, the far-aiming,
the shining wanderer; surely enlivened by the sun, do
men go to their tasks and do their work.' Even his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">267</a></span>
people, the Toltecs, catch from him solar qualities. Will
it be even possible to grant to this famous race, in whose
story the legend of Quetzalcoatl is the leading incident,
anything more than a mythic existence?"<a id="FNanchor_VII-31" href="#Footnote_VII-31" class="fnanchor">[VII-31]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">BRINTON ON QUETZALCOATL.</p>

<p>Dr Brinton is of opinion "that there were in
truth many Quetzalcoatls, for his high priest always bore
his name, but he himself is a pure creation of the fancy,
and all his alleged history is nothing but a myth. His
emblematic name, the Bird-Serpent, and his rebus and
cross at Palenque, I have already explained. Others of
his titles were, Ehecatl, the air; Yolcuat, the rattlesnake;
Tohil, the rumbler; Huemac, the strong hand; Nanihehecatl,
lord of the four winds. The same dualism reappears
in him that has been noted in his analogues
elsewhere. He is both lord of the eastern light and the
wind.</p>

<p>As the former, he was born of a virgin in the land of
Tula or Tlapallan, in the distant Orient, and was high
priest of that happy realm. The morning star was his
symbol, and the temple of Cholula was dedicated to him
expressly as the author of light. As by days we
measure time, he was the alleged inventor of the calendar.
Like all the dawn heroes, he too was represented
as of white complexion, clothed in long white robes, and,
as most of the Aztec gods, with a full and flowing beard.
When his earthly work was done he too returned to the
east, assigning as a reason that the sun, the ruler of
Tlapallan, demanded his presence. But the real motive
was that he had been overcome by Tezcatlipoca, otherwise
called Yoalliehecatl, the wind or spirit of night,
who had descended from heaven by a spider's web and
presented his rival with a draught pretended to confer
immortality, but, in fact, producing uncontrollable longing
for home. For the wind and the light both depart
when the gloaming draws near, or when the clouds
spread their dark and shadowy webs along the mountains,
and pour the vivifying rain upon the fields.</p>

<p>In his other character, he was begot of the breath of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">268</a></span>
Tonacateotl, god of our flesh or subsistence, or (according
to Gomara) was the son of Iztac Mixcoatl, the white
cloud serpent, the spirit of the tornado. Messenger of
Tlaloc, god of rain, he was figuratively said to sweep
the road for him, since in that country violent winds are
the precursors of the wet seasons. Wherever he went
all manner of singing birds bore him company, emblems
of the whistling breezes. When he finally disappeared
in the far east, he sent back four trusty youths who
had ever shared his fortunes, 'incomparably swift and
light of foot,' with directions to divide the earth between
them and rule it till he should return and resume his
power. When he would promulgate his decrees, his
herald proclaimed them from Tzatzitepec, the hill of
shouting, with such a mighty voice that it could be heard
a hundred leagues around. The arrows which he shot
transfixed great trees, the stones he threw leveled forests,
and when he laid his hands on the rocks the mark
was indelible. Yet as thus emblematic of the thunderstorm,
he possessed in full measure its better attributes.
By shaking his sandals he gave fire to men; and peace,
plenty, and riches blessed his subjects. Tradition says
he built many temples to Mictlantecutli, the Aztec Pluto,
and at the creation of the sun that he slew all the other
gods, for the advancing dawn disperses the spectral
shapes of night, and yet all its vivifying power does but
result in increasing the number doomed to fall before the
remorseless stroke of death.</p>

<p>His symbols were the bird, the serpent, the cross and
the flint, representing the clouds, the lightning, the four
winds, and the thunderbolt. Perhaps, as Huemac, the
Strong Hand, he was god of the earthquakes. The Zapotecs
worshiped such a deity under the image of this
number carved from a precious stone, calling to mind
the 'Kab ul,' the Working Hand, adored by the Mayas,
and said to be one of the images of Zamná their hero
god. The human hand, 'that divine tool,' as it has
been called, might well be regarded by the reflective
mind as the teacher of the arts and the amulet whose
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">269</a></span>
magic power has won for man what vantage he has
gained in his long combat with nature and his fellows."<a id="FNanchor_VII-32" href="#Footnote_VII-32" class="fnanchor">[VII-32]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">ANALOGUES OF QUETZALCOATL.</p>

<p>Mr Helps sees in Quetzalcoatl the closest analogies
with certain other great civilizers and teachers that
made their appearance in various parts of the American
continent:&mdash;"One peculiar circumstance, as Humboldt
remarks, is very much to be noted in the ancient records
and traditions of the Indian nations. In no less than
three remarkable instances has superior civilization been
attributed to the sudden presence among them of persons
differing from themselves in appearance and descent.</p>

<p>Bohica, a white man with a beard, appeared to the
Mozca Indians in the plains of Bogota, taught them how
to build and to sow, formed them into communities,
gave an outlet to the waters of the great lake, and, having
settled the government civil and ecclesiastical, retired
into a monastic state of penitence for two thousand
years.</p>

<p>In like manner Manco Capac, accompanied by his
sister, Mama Oello, descended amongst the Peruvians,
gave them a code of admirable laws, reduced them into
communities, and then ascended to his father, the Sun.</p>

<p>Amongst the Mexicans there suddenly appeared Quetzalcoatl
(green-feathered snake), a white and bearded
man, of broad brow, dressed in a strange dress; a
legislator, who recommended severe penances, lacerating
his own body with the prickles of the agave and the
thorns of the cactus, but who dissuaded his followers
from human sacrifice. While he remained in Anáhuac,
it was a Saturnian reign; but this great legislator, after
moving on to the plains of Cholula, and governing the
Cholulans with wisdom, passed away to a distant country,
and was never heard of more. It is said briefly of him
that 'he ordained sacrifices of flowers and fruits, and
stopped his ears when he was spoken to of war.'"<a id="FNanchor_VII-33" href="#Footnote_VII-33" class="fnanchor">[VII-33]</a></p>

<p>The Abbé Domenech considers the tradition of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">270</a></span>
lives of Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca to be a bit of simple
and slightly veiled history, and also that there were
several Quetzalcoatls. Let it be remembered in reading
the abbé's version of this matter that the names of places,
peoples, and the dates he gives are in great part mythical
and conjectural:&mdash;"After the enfranchisement of the
Olmecs, a man named Quetzalcoatl arrived in the country,
whom Garcia, Torquemada, Sahagun, and other Spanish
writers took to be Saint Thomas. It was also at that
time that the third age ended, and that the fourth began,
called Sun of the fire, because it was supposed that it was
in this last stage that the world would be destroyed by
fire.</p>

<p>It is in this fourth period that the Mexican historian
places the Toltecs' arrival in New Spain, that is to say,
about the third century before the Christian era. According
to the Quichés' traditions, the primitive portion
of the Nahoas, or ancestors of the Toltecs, were in a distant
East, beyond immense seas and lands. Amongst
the families and tribes that bore with least patience
this long repose and immobility, those of Canub, and of
Tlocab may be cited, for they were the first who determined
to leave their country. The Nahoas sailed in
seven barks or ships, which Sahagun calls Chicomoztoc,
or the seven grottos. It is a fact worthy of note, that in
all ages the number seven was a sacred number among
the American people, from one pole to the other. It
was at Pánuco, near Tampico, that those strangers disembarked;
they established themselves at Paxil, with
the Votanites' consent, and their state took the name of
Huehue-Tlopallan. It is not stated from whence they
came, but merely that they came out of the regions
where the sun rises. The supreme command was in the
hand of a chieftain, whom history calls Quetzalcohuatl,
that is to say, Lord par excellence. To his care was confided
the holy envelope, which concealed the divinity from
the human gaze, and he alone received from it the
necessary instructions to guide his people's march.
These kinds of divinities, thus enveloped, passed for
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">271</a></span>
being sure talismans, and were looked upon with the
greatest respect and veneration. They consisted generally
of a bit of wood, in which was inserted a little
idol of green stone; this was covered with the skin of a serpent
or of a tiger, after which it was rolled in numerous
little bands of stuff, wherein it would remain wrapped
for centuries together. Such is, perhaps, the origin of
the medicine bags made use of, even in the present day,
by the Indians of the Great Desert, and of which we shall
speak in the second volume of this work."</p>

<p>Of apparently another Quetzalcoatl, he writes: "The
Toltecs became highly flourishing under the reign of
Ceocatl Quetzalcohuatl, a Culhuacan prince, who preached
a new religion, sanctioning auricular confession and the
celibacy of the priests. He proscribed all kinds of warfare
and human sacrifices. Tezcatlipoca put himself at
the head of the dissatisfied party, and besieged Tollan,
the residence of Ceocatl Quetzalcohuatl; but the latter refused
to defend himself, in order to avoid the effusion of
blood, which was prohibited by the laws of the religion
he himself had established, and retired to Cholula, that
had been constructed by his followers. From thence he
went to Yucatan. Tezcatlipoca, his fortunate rival, after
a long reign became in his turn the victim of the popular
discontent, and fell in a battle that was given him
by Ceocatl Quetzalcohuatl's relatives. Those two kings
are elevated to the rank of gods, and their worship was
a perpetual subject of discord and civil war in all
Anáhuac until the arrival of the Spaniards in the New
World."<a id="FNanchor_VII-34" href="#Footnote_VII-34" class="fnanchor">[VII-34]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE CODICES ON QUETZALCOATL.</p>

<p>The interpreters of the different codices, or Mexican
paintings represented in Kingsborough's great work,
give, as is their wont in all matters, a confused, imperfect,
and often erroneous account of Quetzalcoatl:&mdash;"Quetzalcoatl
is he who was born of the virgin, called
Chalchihuitztli, which means the precious stone of penance
or of sacrifice. He was saved in the deluge, and
was born in Zivenaritzcatl where he resides. His fast
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">272</a></span>
was a kind of preparation for the arrival of the end of the
world which they said would happen on the day of Four
Earthquakes, so that they were thus in daily expectation
of that event. Quetzalcoatl was he who they say created
the world, and they bestowed on him the appellation of
lord of the wind, because they said that Tonacatecotli,
when it appeared good to him, breathed and begat
Quetzalcoatl. They erected round temples to him, without
any corners. They said that it was he (who was
also the lord of the thirteen signs which are here represented),
who formed the first man. He alone had a
human body like that of men, the other gods were of an
incorporeal nature."<a id="FNanchor_VII-35" href="#Footnote_VII-35" class="fnanchor">[VII-35]</a></p>

<p>"They declare that their supreme deity, or more properly
speaking, demon Tonacatecotle, whom we have
just mentioned, who by another name was called Citinatonali,
... begot Quetzalcoatl, not by connection with a
woman, but by his breath alone, as we have observed
above, when he sent his ambassador, as they say, to the
virgin of Tulla. They believed him to be the god of the
air, and he was the first to whom they built temples and
churches, which they formed perfectly round, without
any angles. They say it was he who effected the reformation
of the world by penance, as we have already said;
since, according to their account, his father had created
the world, and men had given themselves up to
vice, on which account it had been so frequently destroyed.
Citinatonali sent this his son into the world to
reform it. We certainly must deplore the blindness of
these miserable people, on whom Saint Paul says the
wrath of God has to be revealed, inasmuch as his eternal
truth was so long kept back by the injustice of attributing
to this demon that which belonged to Him; for He
being the sole creator of the universe, and He who made
the division of the waters, which these poor people just
now attributed to the Devil, when it appeared good to
Him, dispatched the heavenly ambassador to announce
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">273</a></span>
to the virgin that she should be the mother of his eternal
word; who, when He found the world corrupt, reformed
it by doing penance and by dying upon the cross
for our sins; and not the wretched Quetzalcoatl, to
whom these miserable people attributed this work.
They assigned to him the dominion over the other
thirteen signs, which are here represented, in the same
manner as they had assigned the preceding thirteen to
his father. They celebrated a great festival on the arrival
of his sign, as we shall see in the sign of Four
Earthquakes, which is the fourth in order here, because
they feared that the world would be destroyed in that
sign, as he had foretold to them when he disappeared in
the Red Sea; which event occurred on the same sign.
As they considered him their advocate, they celebrated
a solemn festival, and fasted during four signs."<a id="FNanchor_VII-36" href="#Footnote_VII-36" class="fnanchor">[VII-36]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">MÜLLER ON QUETZALCOATL.</p>

<p>J. G. Müller holds Quetzalcoatl to be the representative
national god of the Toltecs, surviving under many misconceptions
and amid many incongruities&mdash;bequeathed to
or adopted into the later Mexican religion. The learned
professor has devoted an unusual amount of care and
research to the interpretation of the Quetzalcoatl myths;
and as no other inquirer has shown therein at once so
accurate and extensive an acquaintance with the subject
and so calm and judicious a judgment, we give his
opinion at length, and first his summing up of the fable-history
of Quetzalcoatl:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Toltecs, a traditional pre-historic people, after
leaving their original northern home Huehuetlapallan
(that is Old-red-land) chose Tulla, north of Anáhuac
as the first capital of their newly founded kingdom.
Quetzalcoatl was their high-priest and religious chief
at this place. Huemac, or Huematzin, conducted the
civil government as the companion of Quetzalcoatl, and
wrote the code of the nation. Quetzalcoatl is said to
have been a white man (some gave him a bright red
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">274</a></span>
face), with a strong formation of body, broad forehead,
large eyes, black hair, and a heavy beard. He always
wore a long white robe; which, according to Gomara,
was decorated with crosses; he had a mitre on his head
and a sickle in his hand. At the volcano of Cotcitepec,
or Tzatzitepec, near Tulla, he practised long and numerous
penances, giving thereby an example to his priests
and successors. The name of this volcano means "the
mountain of outcry;" and when Quetzalcoatl gave
laws, he sent a crier to the top of it whose voice
could be heard three hundred miles off. He did
what the founders of religions and cults have done
in other countries: he taught the people agriculture,
metallurgy, stone-cutting, and the art of government.
He also arranged the calendar, and taught his subjects
fit religious ceremonies; preaching specially against
human sacrifices, and ordering offerings of fruits and
flowers only. He would have nothing to do with wars,
even covering his ears when the subject was mentioned.
His was a veritable golden age, as in the time of Saturn;
animals and even men lived in peace, the soil produced
the richest harvests without cultivation, and the grain
grew so large that a man found it trouble enough to
carry one ear; no cotton was dyed, as it grew of all
colors, and fruits of all kinds abounded. Everybody
was rich and Quetzalcoatl owned whole palaces of gold,
silver, and precious stones. The air was filled with the
most pleasant aromas, and a host of finely feathered
birds filled the world with melody.</p>

<p>But this earthly happiness came to an end. Tezcatlipoca
rose up against Quetzalcoatl and against Huemac,
in order to separate them, and to destroy their government.
He descended from the sky on a rope of spider-web
and commenced to work for his object with the aid
of magic arts. He first appeared in the form of a handsome
youth (and in the dress of a merchant), dressed as
a merchant selling pepper-pods, and presented himself
before the daughter of king Huemac. He soon seduced
the princess, and thereby opened the road to a general
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">275</a></span>
immorality and a total collapse of the laws. He presented
himself before Quetzalcoatl in the form of an old
man, with the view of inducing him to depart to his
home in Tlapalla. For this purpose he offered him a
drink which he pretended would endow him with immortality.
No sooner had Quetzalcoatl taken the drink,
then he was seized with a violent desire to see his fatherland.
He destroyed the palaces of gold, silver, and precious
stones, transformed the fruit-trees into withered
trunks, and ordered all song-birds to leave the country,
and to accompany him. Thus he departed, and the birds
entertained him during his journey with their songs.</p>

<p class="sidenote">TRAVELS OF QUETZALCOATL.</p>

<p>He first traveled southward, and arrived in Quauhtitlan,
in Anáhuac. In the vicinity of this town he
broke down a tree by throwing stones, the stones remaining
in the trunk. Farther south, in the same valley,
near Tlalnepantla, or Tanepantla, he pressed hand and
foot into a rock with such force that the impression has
remained down to the latest centuries, in the same manner
as the mark of the shoes of the horses of Castor and
Pollux near Regillum. The Spaniards were inclined
to ascribe these and similar freaks of nature to the Apostle
Thomas.</p>

<p>Quetzalcoatl now turned toward the east, and arrived
in Cholula, where he had to remain for a longer period,
as the inhabitants intrusted him with the government of
their state. The same order of things which had taken
place in Tulla, his first residence, was here renewed.
From this centre his rule spread far and wide; he sent
colonists from Cholula to Huaxayacac, Tabasco and Campeche,
and the nobility of Yucatan prided themselves on
their descent from him; men having been found in our
time who bear his name, just as the descendants of Votan
bore the name of Votan in Chiapas. In Cholula itself
he was adored, and temples were everywhere erected
in his honor, even by the enemies of the Cholulans. After
a residence of twenty years in Cholula, he proceeded on
his journey toward Tlalpalla until he arrived at the
river and in the province of Coatzacoalco, or Goasacoalco,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">276</a></span>
Guasacualco, that is, Hiding-nook of the snake&mdash;south
of Vera Cruz. He now sent the four youths, who had
accompanied him from Cholula, back to the Cholulans,
promising to return later on and renew the old government.
The Cholulans placed the four youths at the head
of their government, out of love for him. This hope of
his return still existed among the Mexican nations at the
time of Cortés' arrival. In fact, Cortés was at first held
to be the returning Quetzalcoatl, and a man was sacrificed
to him, with whose blood the conqueror and his companions
were marked. Father Sahagun was also asked,
by everybody on his journey to Mexico, if he and his suite
came from Tlapalla. According to Montezuma's account
to Cortés, Quetzalcoatl really did once return to Cholula,
but after such a length of time that he found his subjects
married to the native women, having children, and so
numerous that a number of new districts had to be
founded. This new race would not recognize their old
chief, and refused to obey him. He thereupon departed
angrily, threatening to return at another time and to
subdue them by force. It is not remarkable that an
expectation, which was a hope to the Cholulans, should
be a dread to Montezuma and his subjects.</p>

<p>According to some accounts, Quetzalcoatl died in the
Hiding-nook of the snakes, in the Goatzacoalco country;
according to others, he suddenly disappeared toward the
east, and a ship, formed of snakes wound together,
brought him to Tlapalla.</p>

<p>A closer view and criticism of this tale, in the light of
the analogy of mythological laws, shows us that Quetzalcoatl
is the euhemerized religious ideal of the Toltecan
nations. The similarity of this tale with those of Manco
Capac, Botschika, Saturn, and others, is at once apparent.
The opinion of Prescott, Wuttke, and many
others, who held him for a deified man, founder of a
religion and of a civilization, is confirmed by the latest
version of the fable, in which Quetzalcoatl is represented
in this character. Although euhemerism is an old idea
with all people, as well as with the Americans&mdash;personification
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">277</a></span>
being the first step toward it&mdash;the general
reasons which everywhere appear against the existence
of such founders of a civilization must also be made to
speak against this idea of Quetzalcoatl.</p>

<p>If a special value is placed upon the white face and
the beard, it must be remembered that the beard, which
is given to the Mexican priests, could not be omitted
with Quetzalcoatl; and the mention by some of his having
had a white face, and by others a red, might arouse
a suspicion that Quetzalcoatl has been represented as a
white man on account of his white robe.</p>

<p>The fable of Quetzalcoatl contains contradictions, the
younger elements of which are a pure idealism of the
more ancient. For instance, the statement that the
earth produced everything spontaneously, without human
labor, does not agree with the old version of the
myth, according to which Quetzalcoatl taught agriculture
and other industries requiring application and hard
work. The sentimental love of peace has also been attributed
to this god in later times, during a time when the
Toltecs had lost the martial spirit of their victorious ancestors,
and when the Cholulans, given to effeminacy, distinguished
themselves more by cunning than by courage.
The face of the god is represented, in the fable, as more
beautiful and attractive, than it is depicted on the images.
At the place where he was most worshiped, in Cholula,
the statue of Quetzalcoatl stood in his temple, on the
summit of the great pyramid. Its features had a
gloomy cast, and differed from the beautiful face which
is said to have been his on earth.</p>

<p class="sidenote">QUETZALCOATL AND THE TOLTECS.</p>

<p>The fable shows its later idealized elements in these
points. In all other respects, the Toltecan peculiarities of
the entire nation are either clearly and faithfully depicted
in their hero, as in a personified ideal, or else the
original attributes of the nature deity are recognizable.
Where the Toltecs were, there was he also, or a hero
identical with him; the Toltecs who journeyed southward
are colonists sent by him; the Toltec capitals,
Tulla and Cholula, are his residences; and as the laws
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">278</a></span>
of the Toltecs extended far and wide, so did the voice
of his crier reach three hundred miles into the country.
The arts and welfare of the Toltecs, their riches and religious
feeling, even their later unwarlike peacefulness,
all these attributes are transferred to Quetzalcoatl. The
long robe of the Toltecs was also the dress of their
hero; the necktie of the boys of his religious order is
attached to his image; and, as his priests wore the
mitre, he is also represented with it. He is, above all,
depicted as the original model of the Toltec priests, the
Tlamacazque (the order was called Tlamacazcojotl), whose
chief, or superior, always bore the name of Quetzalcoatl.
As these orders of his had to submit to the strictest observances&mdash;their
members having to slit the tongue,
ears and lips in honor of Quetzalcoatl, and the small
boys being set apart for him by making an incision on
their breasts&mdash;so he submitted, before all others, to
these penances on the Tzatzitipec Mountain. These self-inflicted
punishments must not be termed penances, as
is often done, for they have no moral meaning, such as to
do penance for committed sins, nor have they the mystic
meaning of the East Indian idea of the end of the
world (Weltabsterben) and the return to the pantheistic
chaos (Urall and Urnichts); all this is foreign to the
American religion. They are, on the contrary, blood-offerings,
substitutes for the human sacrifices in the
background, to obtain earthly blessings, and to avert
earthly misfortunes. As Quetzalcoatl preached against
human sacrifices, so his priests under the Aztec rule,
were very reluctant to make them. After the great
slaughter by Cortés, in Cholula, Montezuma proceeded
to the great temple of Huitzilopochtli, made many
human sacrifices, and questioned the god, who bade him
to be of good heart, and assured him that the Cholulans
had suffered so terribly merely on account of their reluctance
to offer up human beings.</p>

<p>As the disappearance of the Toltecs toward the south
and the south-east agrees with the disappearance of
Quetzalcoatl, so we find many traits from the end of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">279</a></span>
last Toltec king reproduced in the end of the Toltec hero.
After the defeat of king Tlolpintzin, he (Tlolpintzin)
fled southward, toward Tlapalla. He made use of these
words, in his last farewell to his friends: I have retired
toward the east, but will return after 5012 years to
avenge myself on the descendants of mine enemies.
After having lived thirty years in Tlapalla, he died.
His laws were afterward accepted by Nezalhualcoyotzin.
The belief that Tlolpintzin stayed with Nezalhualcoyotzin,
and some other brave kings, in the cave of Xicco,
after death, like the three Tells of Switzerland, but
would at some time come out and deliver his people, was
long current among the Indians. Every one will notice
how well this agrees with Montezuma's account of the return
of Quetzalcoatl.</p>

<p class="sidenote">QUETZALCOATL A NATURE-DEITY.</p>

<p>Quetzalcoatl cannot, however, be a representative and
a national god of the Toltecs, without having an original
nature-basis for his existence as a god. It is everywhere
the case among savages with their national god,
that the latter is a nature-deity, who becomes gradually
transformed into a national god, then into a national
king, high-priest, founder of a religion, and at last ends
in being considered a human being. The older and purer
the civilization of a people is, the easier it is to recognize
the original essence of its national god, in spite of all
transformations and disguises. So it is here. Behind
the human form of the god glimmers the nature shape,
and the national god is known by, perhaps, all his worshipers
as also a nature deity. From his powerful
influence upon nature, he might also be held as the
creator.</p>

<p>The pure human form of this god, as it appears in the
fable, as well as in the image, is not the original, but
the youngest. His oldest concrete forms are taken from
nature, to which he originally belongs, and have
maintained themselves in many attributes. All these
symbolize him as the god of fertility, chiefly, as it is
made apparent, by means of the beneficial influence of
the air. All Mexican and European statements make
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">280</a></span>
him appear as the god of the air and of the wind; even
the euhemeristic idea deifies the man Quetzalcoatl into
a god of the air. All the Mexican tribes adored him at
the time of the conquest as god of the air, and all accounts,
however much they may differ on the particular
points of his poetical life, agree, without exception, in
this one respect, as the essential and chief point. Besides
the symbols, which are merely attached to the
image, there are three attributes, which represent as
many original visible forms and exteriors of the god, in
which he is represented and worshiped: the sparrow, the
flint (Feuerstein), and the snake.</p>

<p>According to Herrera, the image of Quetzalcoatl had
the body of a man, but the head of a bird, a sparrow
with a red bill, a large comb, and with the tongue hanging
far out of the mouth. The air-god of these northern
people, parallel to Quetzalcoatl, the Aztec Huitzilopochtli,
was represented with devices connected with the humming-bird,
in remembrance of his former humming-bird
nature. This is the northern element. The great spirit
of the northern redskins also appear in his most esteemed
form as a bird. The Latin Picus was originally a woodpecker
(Specht), afterward anthropomorphized and even
euhemerized, but he has ever the woodpecker by his side,
in his capacity of human seer. Several Egyptian gods
have human bodies and animal heads, especially heads of
birds. Birds are not alone symbols of particular godlike
attributes, as used in the anthropomorphic times, not mere
messengers and transmitters of the orders of the gods, but
they have originally been considered as gods themselves,
with forms of godlike powers, especially in North
America; and the exterior of the god of the air, the
fructifying air, is naturally that of a bird, a singing-bird.
The hieroglyphic sign among the Mexicans for
the air is, therefore, the head of a bird with three tongues.
Wherever Quetzalcoatl stayed and ruled, there birds
filled the air, and song-birds gave indication of their
presence; when he departed, he took them with him,
and was entertained during the journey by their singing.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">281</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">QUETZALCOATL AND THE FLINT.</p>

<p>A second form of Quetzalcoatl was the flint, which
we have already learned to know as a symbol and
hieroglyphic sign for the air. He was either represented
as a black stone, or several small green ones,
supposed to have fallen from heaven, most likely ærolites,
which were adored by the Cholulans in the service of
Quetzalcoatl. Bétancourt even explains the meaning of
the name Quetzalcoatl, contrary to the usual definition,
as "twin of a precious stone." The fable of Quauhtitlan
is also connected with this stone-worship; how Quetzalcoatl
had overthrown a tree by means of stones which
remained fixed in it. These stones were later on adored
as holy stones of Quetzalcoatl. The stone at Tlalnepantla,
into which he pressed his hand, must also have represented
the god himself. Similar ancient stone-worships,
of greater nature deities as well as fetiches, were
found, in many instances, in Peru, in the pre-Inca times.
In ancient Central America we meet with the worship
of such green stones called chalchihuites. Votan was
worshiped in the form of such a green stone, connected
with the other two attributes. This attribute of Quetzalcoatl
most likely belongs to the south.</p>

<p>The third form of Quetzalcoatl, which also belongs to
the south, is the snake; he is a snake-god, or, at least,
merged into an ancient snake-god. The snake is not, as
far as I know, a direct symbol of the air, and this attribute
is, therefore, not the one pertaining to him from
the beginning; but the snake represents the season which,
in conjunction with heat and rain, contains the fructifying
influence of the atmosphere, spring, the rejuvenating
year. However, the very name of the god signifies,
according to the usual explanation given to it, "the
feathered snake, the snake covered with feathers, the
green feathered-snake, the wood-snake with rich feathers."
A snake has consequently been added to the
human figure of this god. The other name, under which
he is adored in Yucatan, is Cuculcan, a snake covered
with godlike feathers. The entrance to his round temple
in Mexico represented the jaw and fangs of a tremendous
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">282</a></span>
snake. Quetzalcoatl disappeared in Goatzacoalco,
the Snake-corner (or nook), and a ship of snakes brought
him to Tlapalla. His followers in Yucatan were called
snakes, Cocome (plural of Coatl), while he himself bore
the name of Cocolcan in this country as well as in Chiapas.
The snake attribute signifies, in connection with
Huitzilopochtli, also the beneficial influence of the atmosphere,
the yearly renewed course of nature, the continual
rejuvenation of nature in germs and blossoms. The
northern celestial god, Odin, is in many ways connected
with snakes, he transformed himself into a snake, and
bore the by-name of Snake.</p>

<p>The relationship of Tezcatlipoca and Quetzalcoatl, as
given in the fable, may be touched upon here. The
driving away of the latter by Tezcatlipoca does not, as
may be supposed, signify a contest between the Aztec
religion and the preceding Toltecan. In such a case
Huitzilopochtli, the chief of the Aztec gods, by whose
adoration the contrast is painted in the deepest colors,
would have been a much better representant.</p>

<p>Quetzalcoatl no doubt preached against human sacrifices,
brought into such unprecedented swing by the
Aztecs, yet the worshipers of this god adopted the sacrifice
of human beings in an extensive way during the
Aztec rule, to which period this part of the Quetzalcoatl
fable necessarily owes its origin. At this time the contrast
was so slight that Quetzalcoatl partook of the highest
adoration of Aztecs, not only in Cholula, but in
Mexico and everywhere. His priest enjoyed the highest
esteem and his temple in Mexico stood by the side of
that of Huitzilopochtli. Montezuma not only calls the
Toltec hero a leader of his forefathers, but the Aztecs
actually consider him as a son of Huitzilopochtli. The
opposition of the two gods, Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca,
has another reason: the difference lies not in their worship,
but in their nature and being, in the natural phenomena
which they represent. If the god of the beneficial
atmosphere, the manifested god-power of the atmosphere
of the fructifying seasons, is adored in Quetzalcoatl; then
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">283</a></span>
Tezcatlipoca is his opposite, the god of the gloomy lower
regions destitute of life and germ, the god of drought, of
withering, of death.</p>

<p class="sidenote">QUETZALCOATL AND THE SNAKE.</p>

<p>Wherever, therefore, Quetzalcoatl rules, there are riches
and abundance, the air is filled with fragrance and song-birds&mdash;an
actual golden era; but when he goes southward
with his song-birds, he is expelled by Tezcatlipoca,
drought sets in, and the palaces of gold, silver, and precious
stones, symbols of wealth, are destroyed. He
promises, however, everywhere to return. A representation
mentioned and copied by Humboldt, shows Tezcatlipoca
in the act of cutting up the snake. This
has not the meaning of the acts of Hercules, of Tonatiuh,
of the great spirit of the Chippewas, of the German
Siegfried, of the Celtic dragon-killers Tristan and
Iwein, or of the other sun-gods, spring-gods, and culture-heroes,
who fight and subdue the snake of the unfertile
moisture; such an interpretation would be opposed to the
nature of this god. On the contrary, the god of death
and drought here fights the snake as the symbol of moisture,
of the fertilization of the plant-life.</p>

<p>The question now arises: if Quetzalcoatl only received
his snake attribute in the south, and this his name, what
was his original northern and Toltecan name? We
answer, coinciding with the views expressed by Ixtlilxochitl
and others, who affirm that Quetzalcoatl and his
worldly companion, Huemac, were one and the same
person. The opposed opinion of Ternaux-Compans,
who states that Quetzalcoatl must have been an Olmec,
while Huemac was a Toltec, actually gives the key to
the solution of the question. Both are right, Ixtlilxochitl
and Ternaux, Huemac is the original Toltec name
of the Toltec national god, ruler, and author of the
holy books, the ancient name used by the Toltecs. As
this people succumbed more and more to southern influences,
and their ancient air-god in his sparrow form received
in addition the snake attribute, on account of
his rejuvenating influence upon nature, then, the new
name of the more cultivated people soon appeared.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">284</a></span>
The name may, therefore, be Olmec, but not the god;
we may sooner suppose that the attributes of the Maya
god, Votan, have been transferred to the Toltec god.
Both names having thus a double origin; the legend
which found two names, made also two persons of them,
and placed them side by side. It is, however, easy to
see that they are naturally one: Huemac has just as
much a religious signification as Quetzalcoatl; as Huematzin,
he wrote the divine book, containing all the
earthly and heavenly wisdom of the Toltecs. Quetzalcoatl
has, in the same degree, besides his religious position,
the worldly one of ruler and founder of a civilization.
As Quetzalcoatl possesses a divine nature, so
does Huemac, to whom also are ascribed the three hundred
years of life, and the impression of the hand in the
rock.</p>

<p>Besides the attributes of the sparrow, flint, and snake,
there are others which ascribe to Quetzalcoatl the same
properties, but less prominently. As god of the air,
he holds the wonderfully painted shield in his hand, a
symbol of his power over the winds. As god of the fertilizing
influence of the air, he holds, like Saturn, the
sickle, symbol of the harvest&mdash;he it is that causes the
grain to ripen. It used to be said that he prepared the
way for the water-god, for in these regions, the rains
are always preceded by winds. It was on account of
this intimate connection with the rain, which had
already procured him the snake attribute, that his
mantle was adorned with crosses. We have already seen
that such crosses represented the rain-god with the
Mayas, and are symbols of the fructifying rain. Consequently
they are well suited for the god who is only
air-god in the sense of the air exercising its fructifying
and invigorating influence upon the earth.</p>

<p class="sidenote">QUETZALCOATL AND THE TRADE-WINDS.</p>

<p>Another question, which has already occurred to us,
must here be considered. Why did this god come from
the east, depart toward the east, and why should he be
expected from the east? The Toltecs have, according
to almost unanimous statements, come from the north,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">285</a></span>
and even Quetzalcoatl commences his rule in the north,
in Tulla, and proceeds gradually on his journey from the
north to the south-east, just like the Toltecs, who traveled
southward from Tulla. It is plain that he departs
for the east, because this is his home, from which he came
and will return. His eastern origin is, no doubt, based
upon the direction of the eastern trade-winds, which
carry rain and, with it, fertility to the interior of Central
America. The rains began three or four weeks
earlier in Vera Cruz, Tampico, and Tabasco than in
Puebla and Mexico. Another reason, which has, however,
a certain connection with the above, may be the
relationship of the god of air and the sun-god, who often
assumed an equal position in nature and in worship.
We know that the founders of the Peruvian and Muyscan
cults come from the east, because they are sun-gods.
Quetzalcoatl is not such a deity, it is true, but the fertilizing
air-god is also in other places closely connected
with the fructifying sun, as, for example Huitzilopochtli,
Odin, and Brama. The sun is his eye. This connection
with the sun, Montezuma referred to when he spoke in
the presence of Cortés of the departure of Quetzalcoatl
for the regions from which the sun comes. As the
sun is the eye of heaven, to whom the heart of the victim
sacrificed to the god of heaven is presented, so it is
at night with the moon, to whom the same tribute was
paid at the feast of Quetzalcoatl. I merely refer to this
here to show the connection of the air-god with the great
heavenly bodies.</p>

<p>Several other significations are attached to the idea of
an air-god. It is natural that the god of heavenly blessing
should also be the god of wealth. All wealth depends
originally upon the produce of the soil, upon the blessing
of heaven, however worldly the opinion of the matter may
be. Gold is merely the symbol of this wealth, like the
golden shower of Zeus. The image of Quetzalcoatl was,
therefore, according to Acosta, adorned with gold, silver,
jewels, rich feathers, and gay dresses, to illustrate his
wealth. For this reason he wore a golden helmet,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">286</a></span>
and his sceptre was decorated with costly stones. The
same view is also the basis of the myths of the ancients
about snakes and dragons guarding treasures. The
fact that the merchants of Cholula worshiped the god of
wealth before all others, and as their chief deity, requires
no explanation.</p>

<p>His worship in Cholula was conducted as follows:
Forty days before the festival, the merchants bought a
spotless slave, who was first taken to bathe in a lake
called the Lake of the Gods, then dressed up as the
god Quetzalcoatl, whom he had to represent for forty
days. During this time he enjoyed the same adoration
as was given to the god: he was set upon a raised
place, presented with flowers, and fed on the choicest
viands. He was, however, well guarded during the
night, so that he might not escape. During his exhibition
through the town, he danced and sang, and the women and
children ran out of their houses to salute him and make
him presents. This continued until nine days before the
end of the forty days. Then two old priests approached
him in all humility, saying, in deep voice: Lord, know
that in nine days thy singing and dancing will cease, because
thou must die! If he continued of good spirit, and
inclined to dance and sing, it was considered a good omen,
if the contrary, a bad one. In the latter case they prepared
him a drink of blood and cacao, which was to obliterate
the remembrance of the past conversation.
After drinking this, it was hoped that he would resume
his former good humor. On the day of the festival
still greater honors were shown him, music sounded and
incense was burnt. At last, at the midnight hour, he
was sacrificed, the heart was torn out of his body,
held up to the moon, and then thrown toward the image
of the god. The body was cast down the steps of the
temple, and served the merchants, especially the slave-dealers,
for a sacrificial meal. This feast and sacrifice
took place every year, but after a certain number of
cycles, as in the divine year, Teoxihuitl, they were celebrated
with much more pomp. Quetzalcoatl had, generally,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">287</a></span>
his human sacrifices during the Aztec rule, as well
as the other gods.</p>

<p class="sidenote">QUETZALCOATL AS A HEALING GOD.</p>

<p>The power which reëstablishes the macrocosm, heals
and rejuvenates the microcosm also: it is the general
healing power. With the good weather thousands of
invalids are restored, and refreshing rains not only revive
the thirsty plains of the tropics, but man himself.
Thus the air-god, the atmosphere, becomes a healing
god. A Ph&oelig;nician told Pausanius that the snake god,
Æsculapius, signified the health-restoring air. If this
god of heaven is also a snake-god, like Quetzalcoatl, the
rejuvenating and reinvigorating power of nature is expressed
in a clear parallelism.</p>

<p>The snake-god is also a healing god, and even the
Greek Æsculapius cannot dispense with the snake.
It is, thus, not to be wondered at that the sterile women
of the Mexican peoples directed their prayers to Quetzalcoatl.<a id="FNanchor_VII-37" href="#Footnote_VII-37" class="fnanchor">[VII-37]</a></p>

<p>This concludes the able summing-up presented by
Müller, and it is given as I give all theoretical matter,
neither accepting nor rejecting it, as simply another ray
of light bent in upon the god Quetzalcoatl, whose nature
it is not proposed here to either explain or illustrate,
but only to reproduce, as regarded from many sides by
the earliest and closest observers.</p>

<p class="sidenote">BIRTH OF HUITZILOPOCHTLI.</p>

<p>Huitzilopochtli, Huitziloputzli, or Vitziliputzli, was
the god of war and the especially national god of the
Mexicans. Some said that he was a purely spiritual
being, others that a woman had borne him after miraculous
conception. This legend, following Clavigero, ran
as follows:</p>

<p>In the ancient city of Tulla, lived a most devout
woman, Coatlicue by name. Walking one day in the
temple as her custom was, she saw a little ball of feathers
floating down from heaven, which, taking without
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">289</a></span>
thought, she put into her bosom. The walk being ended,
however, she could not find the ball, and wondered
much, all the more that soon after this she found herself
pregnant. She had already many children, who
now, to avert this dishonor of their house, conspired to
kill her; at which she was sorely troubled. But, from
the midst of her womb the god spoke: Fear not, O my
mother, for this danger will I turn to our great honor
and glory. And lo, Huitzilopochtli, perfect as Pallas
Athena, was instantly born, springing up with a mighty
war-shout, grasping the shield and the glittering spear.
His left leg and his head were adorned with plumes of
green; his face, arms, and thighs barred terribly with
lines of blue. He fell upon the unnatural children, slew
them all, and endowed his mother with their spoils. And
from that day forth his names were Tezahuitl, Terror, and
Tetzauhteotl, Terrible god.</p>

<p>This was the god who became protector of the Mexicans,
who conducted them so many years in their pilgrimage,
and settled them at last on the site of Mexico.
And in this city they raised him that proud temple so
much celebrated even by the Spaniards, in which were
annually held their solemn festivals, in the fifth, ninth,
and fifteenth months; besides those kept every four
years, every thirteen years, and at the beginning of every
century. His statue was of gigantic size, in the posture
of a man seated on a blue-colored bench, from the four
corners of which issued four huge snakes. His forehead
was blue, but his face was covered with a golden mask,
while another of the same kind covered the back of his
head. Upon his head he carried a beautiful crest, shaped
like the beak of a bird; upon his neck a collar consisting
of ten figures of the human heart; in his right hand,
a large, blue, twisted club; in his left, a shield, on which
appeared five balls of feathers disposed in the form of a
cross, and from the upper part of the shield rose a golden
flag with four arrows, which the Mexicans pretended to
have been sent to them from heaven to perform those
glorious actions which we have seen in their history. His
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">290</a></span>
body was girt with a large golden snake, and adorned with
various lesser figures of animals made of gold and precious
stones, which ornaments and insignia had each their
peculiar meaning. They never deliberated upon making
war without imploring the protection of this god, with
prayers and sacrifices; and offered up a greater number
of human sacrifices to him than to any other of the gods.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-1" href="#Footnote_VIII-1" class="fnanchor">[VIII-1]</a></p>

<p>A different account of the origin of this deity is given
by Boturini, showing the god to have been a brave Mexican
chief, who was afterward apotheosized:&mdash;</p>

<p>While the Mexicans were pushing their conquests and
their advance toward the country now occupied by them,
they had a very renowned captain, or leader, called
Huitziton. He it was that in these long and perilous
journeys through unknown lands, sparing himself no
fatigue, took care of the Mexicans. The fable says of
him that being full of years and wisdom he was one
night caught up in sight of his army, and of all his
people, and presented to the god Tezauhteotl, that is to
say the Frightful God, who, being in the shape of a
horrible dragon, commanded him to be seated at his
right hand, saying: Welcome, O valiant captain; very
grateful am I for thy fidelity in my service and in governing
my people. It is time that thou shouldest rest,
since thou art already old, and since thy great deeds
raise thee up to the fellowship of the immortal gods.
Return then to thy sons and tell them not to be afflicted
if in future they cannot see thee as a mortal man; for
from the nine heavens thou shalt look down propitious
upon them. And not only that, but also, when I strip
the vestments of humanity from thee, I will leave to
thine afflicted and orphan people thy bones and thy
skull so that they may be comforted in their sorrow, and
may consult thy relics as to the road they have to follow:
and in due time the land shall be shown them that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">291</a></span>
I have destined for them, a land in which they shall
hold wide empire, being respected of the other nations.</p>

<p>Huitziton did according to these instructions, and after
a sorrowful interview with his people, disappeared,
carried away by the gods. The weeping Mexicans remained
with the skull and bones of their beloved captain,
which they carried with them till they arrived in New
Spain, and at the place where they built the great city
of Tenochtitlan, or Mexico. All this time the devil
spoke to them through this skull of Huitziton, often asking
for the immolation of men and women, from which
thing originated those bloody sacrifices, practiced afterwards
by this nation with so much cruelty on prisoners
of war. This deity was called, in early as well as in
later times, Huitzilopochtli&mdash;for the principal men believed
that he was seated at the left hand of Tezcatlipoca&mdash;a
man derived from the original name Huitziton, and
from the word <i>mapoche</i>, 'left hand.'<a id="FNanchor_VIII-2" href="#Footnote_VIII-2" class="fnanchor">[VIII-2]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">IMAGE OF HUITZILOPOCHTLI.</p>

<p>Acosta gives a minute description of the image and
temple of this god:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The chiefest idoll of Mexico was, as I have sayde,
Vitziliputzli. It was an image of wood like to a man,
set vpon a stoole of the colour of azure, in a brankard or
litter, at every corner was a piece of wood in forme of a
Serpent's head. The stoole signified that he was set in
heaven: this idoll hadde all the forehead azure, and had
a band of azure vnder the nose from one eare to another:
vpon his head he had a rich plume of feathers, like to
the beake of a small bird, the which was covered on the
toppe with golde burnished very browne: hee had in his
left hand a white target, with the figures of five pine
apples, made of white feathers, set in a crosse: and from
above issued forth a crest of gold, and at his sides hee
hadde foure dartes, which (the Mexicaines say) had
beene sent from heaven to do those actes and prowesses
which shall be spoken of: In his right hand he had an
azured staffe, cutte in fashion of a waving snake. All
those ornaments with the rest hee had, carried his sence
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">292</a></span>
as the Mexicaines doe shew; the name of Vitziliputzli
signifies the left hand of a shining feather. I will
speake heereafter of the prowde Temple, the sacrifices,
feasts and ceremonies of this great idoll, being very
notable things. But at this present we will only shew,
that this idoll thus richly appareled and deckt, was set
vpon an high Altare, in a small peece or boxe, well
covered with linnen clothes, jewells, feathers and ornaments
of golde, with many rundles of feathers, the fairest
and most exquisite that could be found: hee had alwaies
a curtine before him for the greater veneration. Ioyning
to the chamber or chappell of this idoll, there was a
peece of lesse worke, and not so well beautified, where
there was another idoll they called Tlaloc. These two
idolls were alwayes together, for that they held them as
companions, and of equal power.</p>

<p class="sidenote">TEMPLE OF HUITZILOPOCHTLI.</p>

<p>There was in Mexico, this Cu, the famous Temple
of Vitziliputzli, it had a very great circuite, and within
a faire Court. It was built of great stones, in fashion of
snakes tied one to another, and the circuite was called
Coatepantli, which is, a circuite of snakes: vppon the
toppe of every chamber and oratorie where the Idolls
were, was a fine piller wrought with small stones, blacke
as ieate, set in goodly order, the ground raised vp with
white and red, which below gave a great light. Vpon
the top of the pillar were battlements very artificially
made, wrought like snailes [caracoles], supported by two
Indians of stone, sitting, holding candlesticks in their
hands, the which were like Croisants garnished and enriched
at the ends, with yellow and greene feathers and
long fringes of the same. Within the circuite of this
court, there were many chambers of religious men, and
others that were appointed for the service of the Priests
and Popes, for so they call the soveraigne Priests which
serve the Idoll.</p>

<p>There were foure gates or entries, at the east, west,
north, and south; at every one of these gates beganne a
faire cawsey of two or three leagues long. There was in
the midst of the lake where the cittie of Mexico is built,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">293</a></span>
foure large cawseies in crosse, which did much beautify
it; vpon every portall or entry, was a God or Idoll,
having the visage turned to the causey, right against
the Temple gate of Vitziliputzli. There were thirtie
steppes of thirtie fadome long, and they divided from
the circuit of the court by a streete that went betwixt
them; vpon the toppe of these steppes there was a walke
thirtie foote broad, all plaistered with chalke, in the
midst of which walke was a Pallisado artificially made
of very high trees, planted in order a fadome one from
another. These trees were very bigge, and all pierced
with small holes from the foote to the top, and there
were roddes did runne from one tree to another, to the
which were chained or tied many dead mens heades.
Vpon every rod were twentie sculles, and these ranckes
of sculles continue from the foote to the toppe of the tree.
This Pallissado was full of dead mens sculls from one
end to the other, the which was a wonderfull mournefull
sight and full of horror. These were the heads of
such as had beene sacrificed; for after they were dead,
and had eaten the flesh, the head was delivered to the
Ministers of the Temple, which tied them in this sort
vntil they fell off by morcells; and then had they a care
to set others in their places. Vpon the toppe of the
temple were two stones or chappells, and in them were
the two Idolls which I have spoken of, Vitziliputzli, and
his companion Tlaloc. These Chappells were carved and
graven very artificially, and so high, that to ascend vp to
it, there was a staire of stone of sixscore steppes. Before
these Chambers or Chappells, there was a Court of fortie
foote square, in the midst thereof, was a high stone of
five hand breadth, poynted in fashion of a Pyramide, it
was placed there for the sacrificing of men; for being
laid on their backes, it made their bodies to bend, and
so they did open them and pull out their hearts, as I
shall shew heereafter."<a id="FNanchor_VIII-3" href="#Footnote_VIII-3" class="fnanchor">[VIII-3]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294">294</a></span></p>

<p>Solis describes this temple also:&mdash;</p>

<p>The top of the truncated pyramid on which the idols
of Huitzilopochtli and Tlaloc were placed was forty feet
square, and reached by a stair of a hundred and twenty
steps. On this platform, on either hand, at the head of
the stairs, stood two sentinel-statues supporting great candlesticks
of an extraordinary fashion. And first, from
the jasper flags, rose a hump-backed altar of green stone.
Opposite and beyond was the chapel wherein behind
curtains sat Huitzilopochtli, on a throne supported by a
blue globe. From this, supposed to represent the heavens,
projected four staves with serpents' heads, by which
the priests carried the god when he was brought
before the public. The image bore on its head a bird of
wrought plumes whose beak and crest were of burnished
gold. The feathers expressed horrid cruelty and were
made still more ghastly by two stripes of blue one on the
brow and the other on the nose. Its right hand leaned
as on a staff upon a crooked serpent. Upon the left arm
was a buckler bearing five white plumes, arranged in form
of a cross; and the hand grasped four arrows venerated
as heaven-descended. To the left of this was another
chapel, that of Tlaloc. Now these two chapels and idols
were the same in every particular. These gods were
esteemed brothers&mdash;their attributes, qualities, powers,
inclinations, service, prayers, and so on, were identical
or interchangeable.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-4" href="#Footnote_VIII-4" class="fnanchor">[VIII-4]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">HUITZILOPOCHTLI AND CAMAXTLI.</p>

<p>Sahagun says of Huitzilopochtli, that, being originally
a man, he was a sort of Hercules, of great strength and
warlike, a great destroyer of towns and slayer of men.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">295</a></span>
In war he had been a living fire, very terrible to his
adversaries; and the devise he bore was a dragon's head,
frightful in the extreme, and casting fire out of its
mouth. A great wizard he had been, and sorcerer, transforming
himself into the shape of divers birds and beasts.
While he lived, the Mexicans esteemed this man very
highly for his strength and dexterity in war, and when
he died they honored him as a god, offering slaves, and
sacrificing them in his presence. And they looked to it
that those slaves were well fed and well decorated with
such ornaments as were in use, with ear-rings and visors;
all for the greater honor of the god. In Tlaxcala also
they had a deity, called Camaxtli, who was similar to
this Huitzilopochtli.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-5" href="#Footnote_VIII-5" class="fnanchor">[VIII-5]</a></p>

<p>Gage, in a pretty fair translation of Herrera, describes
this god with Tezcatlipoca. He says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The gods of Mexico (as the Indians reported to the
first Spaniards) were two thousand in number; the
chiefest were Vitzilopuchtli, and Tezcatlipoca, whose
images stood highest in the temple upon the altars.
They were made of stone in full proportion as big as
a giant. They were covered with a lawn called Nacar;
they were beset with pearls, precious stones, and
pieces of gold, wrought like birds, beasts, fishes, and
flowers, adorned with emeralds, turquies, chalcedons,
and other little fine stones, so that when the lawn was
taken away, the images seemed very beautiful and glorious
to behold. These two Indian idols had for a girdle great
snakes of gold, and for collars or chains about their
necks ten hearts of men made of gold; and each of them
had a counterfeit visor with eyes of glass, and in their
necks Death painted. These two gods were brethren,
for Tezcatlipoca was the god of providence, and Vitzilopuchtli,
god of the wars, who was worshiped and feared
more than all the rest."<a id="FNanchor_VIII-6" href="#Footnote_VIII-6" class="fnanchor">[VIII-6]</a></p>

<p>Torquemada goes to some length into the legend
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">296</a></span>
and description of this god of war, Huitzilopochtli, or
Mexitl:<a id="FNanchor_VIII-7" href="#Footnote_VIII-7" class="fnanchor">[VIII-7]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p>Huitzilopochtli, the ancient god and guide of the
Mexicans, is a name variously derived. Some say it is
composed of two words: <i>huitzilin</i>, 'a humming-bird', and
<i>tlahuipuchtli</i>, 'a sorcerer that spits fire.' Others say that
the second part of the name comes not from tlahuipuchtli,
but from <i>opuchtli</i>, that is, 'the left hand;' so that the
whole name, Huitzilopochtli, would mean 'the shining-feathered
left hand.' For this idol was decorated with
rich and resplendent feathers on the left arm. And
this god it was that led out the Mexicans from their own
land and brought them into Anáhuac.</p>

<p>Some held him to be a purely spiritual being, others
affirmed that he had been born of a woman, and related
his history after the following fashion: Near the city of
Tulla there is a mountain called Coatepec, that is to say
the Mountain of the Snake, where a woman lived, named
Coatlicue, or Snake-petticoat. She was the mother of
many sons called Centzunhuitznahua, and of a daughter
whose name was Coyolxauhqui. Coatlicue was very
devout and careful in the service of the gods, and she
occupied herself ordinarily in sweeping and cleaning the
sacred places of that mountain. It happened that one
day, occupied with these duties, she saw a little ball of
feathers floating down to her through the air, which she
taking, as we have already related, found herself in a
short time pregnant.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-8" href="#Footnote_VIII-8" class="fnanchor">[VIII-8]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">DOUGH STATUE OF HUITZILOPOCHTLI.</p>

<p>Upon this all her children conspired against her to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">297</a></span>
slay her, and came armed against her, the daughter
Coyolxauhqui being the ringleader and most violent
of all. Then, immediately, Huitzilopochtli was born,
fully armed, having a shield called <i>teuehueli</i> in his left
hand, in his right a dart, or long blue pole, and all his
face barred over with lines of the same color. His forehead
was decorated with a great tuft of green feathers,
his left leg was lean and feathered, and both thighs and
the arms barred with blue. He then caused to appear
a serpent made of torches, <i>teas</i>, called <i>xiuhcoatl</i>; and
he ordered a soldier named Tochaucalqui to light this
serpent, and taking it with him, to embrace Coyolxauhqui.
From this embrace the matricidal daughter immediately
died, and Huitzilopochtli himself slew all her
brethren and took their spoil, enriching his mother
therewith. After this he was surnamed Tetzahuitl, that
is to say, Fright, or Amazement, and held as a god, born
of a mother, without a father&mdash;as the great god of battles,
for in these his worshipers found him very favorable
to them. Besides the ordinary image of this god,
permanently set up in the great temple of Mexico,
there was another, renewed every year, made of grains
and seeds of various kinds. In one of the halls in the
neighborhood of the temple the priests collected and
ground up with great devotion a mass of seeds, of the amaranth
and other plants, moistening the same with the
blood of children, and making a dough thereof, which
they shaped into a statue of the form and stature of a
man. The priests carried this image to the temple and
the altar, previously arranged for its reception, playing
trumpets and other instruments, and making much noise
and ado with dancing and singing at the head of the
procession. All this during the night; in the morning
the high-priest and the other priests blessed and consecrated
the image, with such blessing and consecration as
were in use among them. This done, and the people
assembled, every person that could come at the image
touched it wherever he could, as Christians touch a relic,
and made offerings thereto, of jewels of gold and precious
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">298</a></span>
stones, each according to his means and devotion,
sticking the said offerings into the soft fresh dough of
which the idol was confected. After this ceremony
no one was allowed to touch the image any more, nor to
enter the place where it was, save only the high-priest.
After that they brought out the image of the god Paynalton,<a id="FNanchor_VIII-9" href="#Footnote_VIII-9" class="fnanchor">[VIII-9]</a>&mdash;who
is also a war god, being vicar or sub-captain
of the said Huitzilopochtli&mdash;an image made of
wood. It was carried in the arms of a priest who represented
the god Quetzalcoatl, and who was decorated
with ornaments rich and curious. Before this priest
there marched another carrying [the image of] a great
snake, large and thick, twisted and of many coils. The
procession filed along at great length, and here and there
at various temples and altars the priests offered up sacrifices,
immolating human captives and quails. The
first station, or stopping-place, was at the ward of Teotlachco.
Thence the cortège passed to Tlatelulco (where
I, Torquemada, am now writing this history); then to
Popotlan; then to Chapultepec&mdash;nearly a league from,
the city of Mexico; then to Tepetoca; then to Acachinanco;
then back again to the temple whence it had set
out; and then the image of Paynalton was put on the
altar where stood that of Huitzilopochtli, being left there
with the banner, called <i>ezpaniztli</i>, that had been carried
before it during the march: only the great snake, mentioned
above, was carried away and put in another place,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299">299</a></span>
to which it belonged. And at all these places where
the procession appeared, it was received with incensings,
sacrifices, and other ceremonies.</p>

<p>This procession finished, it having occupied the greater
part of the day, all was prepared for a sacrifice. The
king himself acted the part of priest; taking a censer,
he put incense therein with certain ceremonies and incensed
the image of the god. This done, they took down
again the idol, Paynalton, and set out in march, those
going in front that had to be sacrificed, together with all
things pertaining to the fatal rite. Two or three times
they made the circle of the temple, moving in horrid
cortège, and then ascended to the top, where they slew
the victims; beginning with the prisoners of war, and
finishing with the fattened slaves, purchased for the
occasion, rending out their hearts and casting the same
at the feet of the idol.</p>

<p class="sidenote">SYMBOLIC DEATH OF HUITZILOPOCHTLI.</p>

<p>All through this day the festivities and the rejoicings
continued, and all the day and night the priests watched
vigilantly the dough statue of Huitzilopochtli, so that no
oversight or carelessness should interfere with the veneration
and service due thereto. Early next day they took
down said statue and set it on its feet in a hall. Into
this hall there entered the priest, called after Quetzalcoatl,
who had carried the image of Paynalton in his
arms in the procession, as before related; there entered
also the king, with one of the most intimate servants,
called Tehua, of the god Huitzilopochtli, four other
great priests, and four of the principal youths, called
Telpochtlatoque, out of the number of those that had
charge of the other youths of the temple. These mentioned,
and these alone, being assembled, the priest
named after Quetzalcoatl took a dart tipped with flint
and hurled it into the breast of the statue of dough,
which fell on receiving the stroke. This ceremony was
styled, 'killing the god Huitzilopochtli so that his body
might be eaten.' Upon this the priests advanced to
the fallen image and one of them pulled the heart out of
it, and gave the same to the king. The other priests
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">300</a></span>
cut the pasty body into two halves. One half was given
to the people of Tlatelulco, who parted it out in crumbs
among all their wards, and specially to the young
soldiers&mdash;no woman being allowed to taste a morsel.
The other half was allotted to the people of that part of
Mexico called Tenochtlitlan; it was divided among the
four wards, Teopan, Atzaqualco, Quepopan, and Moyotlan;
and given to the men, to both small and great, even
to the men-children in the cradle. All this ceremony
was called <i>teoqualo</i>, that is to say, 'god is eaten,' and
this making of the dough statue and eating of it was renewed
once every year.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-10" href="#Footnote_VIII-10" class="fnanchor">[VIII-10]</a></p>

<p>Closely as J. G. Müller studied the character of Quetzalcoatl,
his examination of that of Huitzilopochtli, has
been still more minute and was indeed the subject of a
monograph published by him in 1847. A student of
the subject cannot afford to overlook this study, and I
translate the more important parts of it in the paragraphs
which follow; not, indeed, either for or against the interests
of the theory it supports, but for the sake of the
accurate and detailed handling, rehandling, and grouping
there, by a master in this department of mythological
learning, of almost all the data relating to the matter
in hand:&mdash;</p>

<p>Huitzilopochtli has been already referred to as an original
god of the air and of heaven. He agrees also with
Quetzalcoatl in a second capital point, in having become
the anthropomorphic national god of the Aztecs,
as Quetzalcoatl of the Toltecs. On their marches and
in their wars, in the establishment of codes and towns,
in happiness as well as in misfortune, the Aztecs were
guided by his oracle, by the spirit of his being. As the
Toltecs, especially in their later national character,
differ from the Aztecs, so differ their two chief national
gods. If the capital of the Toltecs, Cholula, resembled
modern Rome in its religious efforts, so the god enthroned
there was transformed into the human form of a high-priest,
in whom this people saw his human ideal. In
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301">301</a></span>
the same manner one might be led to compare the capital
of the Aztecs with ancient Rome, on account of its
warlike spirit, and therefore it was right to make the
national god of the Aztecs a war god like the Roman
Mars.</p>

<p class="sidenote">THE NAME HUITZILOPOCHTLI.</p>

<p>We will commence with the name of the god, which,
according to Sahagun, Acosta, Torquemada, and most of
the writers, signifies 'on the left side a humming-bird;'
from <i>huitzilin</i>, 'a humming-bird,' and <i>opochtli</i>, 'left.'
In connecting the Aztec words, the ending is cut off.
The image of the god had in reality, frequently, the
feathers of the humming-bird on the left foot. The connection
of this bird with the god is, in many ways, appropriate.
It no doubt appeared to them as the most
beautiful of birds, and as the most worthy representant
of their chief deity. Does not its crest glitter like a
crown set with rubies and all kinds of precious stones?
The Aztecs have accordingly, in their way, called the
humming-bird, 'sun-beam,' 'or sun-hair;' as its alighting
upon flowers, is like that of a sun-beam. The chief god
of the Caribs, Juluca, is also decorated with a band
of its feathers round the forehead. The ancient Mexicans
had, as their most noble adornment, state-mantles
of the same feathers, so much praised by Cortés; and
even at the present time the Aztec women adorn their
ears with these plumes. This humming-bird decoration
on the left foot of the god was not the only one; he
had also a green bunch of plumage upon his head, shaped
like the bill of a small bird. The shield in his left hand
was decorated with white feathers, and the whole image
was at times covered with a mantle of feathers. To
the general virtues which make comprehensible the
humming-bird attribute as a divine one, must be added
the special virtue of bravery peculiar to this bird, which
is specially suited to the war god. The English traveler
Bullock tells how this bird distinguishes itself
for its extraordinary courage, attacking others ten
times its own size, flying into their eyes, and using
its sharp bill as a most dangerous weapon. Nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302">302</a></span>
more daring can be witnessed than its attack upon
other birds of its own species, when it fears disturbance
during the breeding-season. The effects of jealousy
transform these birds into perfect furies, the throat
swells, the crest on their head, the tail, and the wings
are expanded; they fight whistling in the air, until one
of them falls exhausted to the ground. That such a
martial spirit should exist in so small a creature
shows the intensity of this spirit; and the religious
feeling is the sooner aroused, when the instrument of a
divine power appears in so trifling and weak a body.
The small but brave and warlike woodpecker stood in a
similar relation to Mars, and is accordingly termed <i>picus
martius</i>.</p>

<p>This, the most common explanation of the name Huitzilopochtli,
as 'humming-bird, left side' is not followed
by Veytia, with whom Prichard agrees. He declares
the meaning of the name to be 'left hand,' from <i>huitzitoc</i>,
'hand,' because Huitzilopochtli, according to the
fable, after his death, sits on the left side of the god
Tezcatlipoca, Now, Huitzilopochtli is in another place
considered as the brother of this god; he also stands
higher, and can therefore scarcely have obtained his
name from his position with respect to the other deity.
Besides, hand in Aztec is properly translated as <i>maitl</i>, or
<i>toma</i>.</p>

<p>Over and above this attribute which gives the god his
name, there are others which point towards the conception
of a war god. Huitzilopochtli had, like Mars and
Odin, the spear, or a bow, in his right hand, and in
the left, sometimes a bundle of arrows, sometimes a
round white shield, on the side of which were the four
arrows sent him from heaven wherewith to perform
the heroic deeds of his people. On these weapons depended
the welfare of the state, just as on the <i>ancile</i>
of the Roman Mars, which had fallen from the sky, or
on the <i>palladium</i> of the warlike Pallas Athena.</p>

<p>By-names also point out Huitzilopochtli as war god;
for he is called the terrible god, Tetzateotl, or the raging,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303">303</a></span>
Tetzahuitl. These names he received at his birth,
when he, just issued from his mother's womb, overthrew
his adversaries.</p>

<p class="sidenote">KINDRED OF HUITZILOPOCHTLI.</p>

<p>Not less do his connections indicate his warlike nature.
His youngest brother, Tlacahuepancuextotzin, was also
a war god, whose statue existed in Mexico, and who received
homage, especially in Tezcuco. In still closer
relationship to him stands his brother-in-arms, or, as
Bernal Diaz calls him, his page, Paynalton, that is,
'the fleet one;' he was the god of the sudden war
alarm, <i>tumultus</i> or general <i>levée en masse</i>; his call
obliged all capable of bearing arms to rush to the defence.
He is otherwise considered as the representant
of Huitzilopochtli and subordinate to him, for he was
only a small image, as Diaz says, and as the ending <i>ton</i>
denotes. The statue of this little war-crier was always
placed upon the altar of Huitzilopochtli, and sometimes
carried round at his feast.</p>

<p>Other symbolic attributes establish Huitzilopochtli as
the general national god of this warlike people, and symbolized
his personal presence. On the march from the
ancient home, the priests took their turn, in fours, to
carry his wooden image, with the little flag fallen from
heaven, and the four arrows. The litter, upon which
the image was carried, was called the 'chair of god,'
<i>teoicpalli</i>, and was a holy box, such as was used among
the Etruscans and Egyptians, the Greeks and the Romans,
in Ilium, among the Japanese, among the Mongols.
In America, the Cherokees are also found with
such an ark. The ark of the covenant carried by the
Levites through the desert and in battle, was of a similar
kind. Wherever the Aztecs halted for some time
during their wanderings, they erected an altar or a
sacrifice mound to their god, upon which they placed
this god's-litter with the image; which ancient observance
they kept up, in later times, in their temples.
By its side they erected a movable tent, <i>tabernaculum</i>,
(Stiftshütte), in the open country, as is customary
among nomadic people, such as the Mongols. The god,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304">304</a></span>
however, gave them the codes and usages of a cultured
people, and received offerings of prisoners, hawks, and
quails.</p>

<p>As the head of a sparrow on a human body points to
the former worship of Quetzalcoatl under the form of
a sparrow, so the humming-bird attribute on the image
and in the name of Huitzilopochtli, points him out as an
original animal god. The general mythological rule, that
such animal attributes refer to an ancient worship of the
god in question under the form of an animal, points this
out in his case, and the special myth of Huitziton assists
here in the investigation of the foundation of this original
nature.</p>

<p>When the Aztecs still lived in Aztlan, a certain
Huitziton enjoyed their highest esteem, as the fable
tells. This Huitziton heard the voice of a bird, which
cried "tihui," that is 'let us go.'<a id="FNanchor_VIII-11" href="#Footnote_VIII-11" class="fnanchor">[VIII-11]</a> He thereupon
asked the people to leave their home, which they accordingly
did. When we consider the name Huitziton,
the nature of the story, and the mythical time to
which it refers, no doubt remains as to who this Huitziton
is supposed to be. It is evident that he is none
other than the little bird itself, which, in our later form
of the myth, as an anthropomorphic fable, is separated
from him; separated euhemeristically, just as the Latin
Picus was separated from his woodpecker. This Picus,
whose songs and flight were portentous, was represented
as a youth with a woodpecker on his head, of
which he made use for his seer-art; but was originally,
as denoted by his name, nothing else than a woodpecker,
which was adored on the wooden pillar from which it
sent its sayings. This woodpecker placed itself upon the
<i>vexillum</i> of the Sabines, and guided them to the region
which has been named Picenum after it. As this bird
guided its people to their new abode, like Huitziton,
so many other animal gods have lead those who, in
ancient times, sought new homes. Thus a crow conducted
Battus to Cyrene; a dove led the Chalcidians
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305">305</a></span>
to Cyrene; Apollo, in the form of a dolphin, took
the Cretans to Pytho; Antinous founded a new settlement,
to which a snake had pointed the way; a bull
carried Cadmus to Thebes; a wolf led the Hirpinians.
The original stock of the South American people, the
Mbayas, received the divine order, through the bird Caracara,
to roam as enemies in the territories of other
people instead of settling down in a fixed habitation&mdash;this
is an anti-culture myth. As the founding of towns
favors the birth of myths like the preceding, so also does
the founding of convents, the sites of which, according
to the numerous fables of the Christian mediæval age,
were pointed out by animals&mdash;one of the remnants of
old heathenism then existing in the popular fancy. To
resume the subject, Huitziton is, therefore, the humming-bird
god, who, as oracular god, commanded the Aztecs
to emigrate. His name signifies nothing else than 'small
humming-bird,' the ending <i>ton</i> being a diminutive
syllable, as in Paynalton. Thus the humming-bird was
the bearer, at the time of the great flood, of the divine
message of joy to the Tezpi of the Michoacans, a people
related to the Aztecs. It had been let loose as the
water receded, and soon returned with a small twig to
the ark.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-12" href="#Footnote_VIII-12" class="fnanchor">[VIII-12]</a> On the Catherine Islands [islands of Santa
Catalina],<a id="FNanchor_VIII-13" href="#Footnote_VIII-13" class="fnanchor">[VIII-13]</a> in California, crows were adored as interpreters
of the divine will. From the above it is also
self-evident that Huitziton and Huitzilopochtli were one,
which is the conclusion arrived at by the learned researcher
of Mexican languages and traditions, the Italian
Boturini. The name, myth, and attributes of Huitzilopochtli
point then to the humming-bird. Previous to
the transformation of this god, by anthropomorphism,
he was merely a small humming-bird, <i>huitziton</i>; by
anthropomorphism, the bird became, however, merely
the attribute, emblem or symbol, and name of the god&mdash;a
name which changed with his form into 'humming-bird
on the left,' or Huitzilopochtli.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306">306</a></span></p>

<p>The identity of the two, in spite of the different explanations
of the name, is accepted by Veytia, who gives
Huitzitoc as the name of the chief who led the Aztec
armies during their last wanderings from Chicomoztoc, or
the Seven Caves, into Anáhuac. Under his leadership
the Aztecs were everywhere victorious, and for this
reason he was placed, after his death, on the left side of
the god Tezcatlipoca; since which time he was called
Huitzilopochtli.</p>

<p class="sidenote">HUITZITON AND PAYNALTON.</p>

<p>The identity of Huitziton and Huitzilopochtli, is also
shown by other facts besides the name, the attribute, and
the mythological analogy: the same important acts are
ascribed to both. We have seen that Huitziton commanded
the Aztecs to leave their home; according to
another account of Acosta, this was done on the persuasion
of Huitzilopochtli. If other Spanish authors state
that this was done by instigation of the devil, they mean
none other than Huitzilopochtli, using a mode of speech
which had become an established one. This name became
a common title of the devil in Germany, under the form
of Vizliputzli, soon after the conquest of Mexico, as may
be seen in the old popular drama of Faust. The fable
further relates of Huitziton that he taught the Aztecs to
produce fire by friction, during their wanderings. The
gift of fire is usually ascribed to a culture-god. Huitzilopochtli
was such a deity; he introduced dress, laws, and
ceremonies among his people. The statement that Huitziton
had at some time, given fire to the people, has no
historical meaning; there is no people without fire, and
a formerly told myth mentions that man made fire even
before the existence of the present sun. The signification
of the fable is a religious one, it is a myth in which
the Aztecs ascribe the origin of all human culture to
Huitziton their culture-god, afterward Huitzilopochtli.</p>

<p class="sidenote">SACRIFICE MYTHS.</p>

<p>This god wore also a band of human hearts and faces
of gold and silver; while various bones of dead men, as
well as a man torn in pieces, were depicted on his dress.
These attributes like those of the Indian Schiwa and
Kali, clearly point him out as the god to whom human
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307">307</a></span>
sacrifices were made. It was extensively believed
among the nations composing the Mexican Empire that
human sacrifices had been introduced by the Aztecs
within the last two centuries. Before that time only
bloodless offerings had been made. A myth places the
commencement of human sacrifices in the fourteenth
century, in which the three first successive cases thereof
are said to have occurred.</p>

<p>The Colhuas, the ruling nation at that time in the
valley of Anáhuac, are said to have fought a battle with
their enemies of Xochimilco, which was decided in favor
of the Colhuas, owing to the impetuous attack made by
the tributary Aztecs in their aid. While the Colhuas
were presenting a large number of prisoners before their
king, the Aztecs had only secured four, whom they kept
secreted, but exhibited, in token of their bravery, a number
of ears that they had cut from their slain enemies,
boasting that the victory would have been much delayed
had they lost time in making prisoners. Proud of their
triumph, they erected an altar to Huitzilopochtli, in
Huitzilopochco, and made known to their lord, the king
of the Colhuas, that they desired to offer this god a
costly and worthy sacrifice. The king sent them, by
the hands of priests, a dead bird, which the messengers
laid irreverently upon the altar, and departed.
The Aztecs swallowed their chagrin, and set a fragrant
herb with a knife of iztli beside the bird. As
the king with his suite arrived at the festival, more
for the sake of mocking the proceedings than to grace
them, the four prisoners taken from the Xochimilcos
were brought out, placed upon the stone of sacrifice,
their breasts cut open with the iztli, and the palpitating
heart torn out. This sacrifice brought consternation
upon the Colhuas, they discharged the Aztecs from
their service and drove them away. The Aztecs wandered
for some time about the country, and then, at the
command of their god, founded the town of Tenochtitlan,
or Mexico, on a site where they had found a nopal
(Opuntie) growing upon a rock.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308">308</a></span></p>

<p>At the second sacrifice a Colhua was the victim.
An Aztec was hunting, on the shore of the lake, for an
animal to offer his patron deity, when he met a Colhua
called Xomimitl; he attacks him furiously, bears him
down, and the defeated man is made to bleed upon the
sacrifice stone.</p>

<p>Both myths are aitiological, and explained by the
sacrifice system (Opferkultus). This is shown in the
case of the four prisoners, of whom we shall learn more
in the third story. The second story personifies the
Aztec and the Colhua peoples in the two men, the
second nation supplying the first with human sacrifices.
With the sacrifice of Xomimitl, the parallelism of which
to the four Xochimilcos cannot be overlooked by any
one, the first temple of Huitzilopochtli, in Tenochtitlan,
was inaugurated.</p>

<p>The third sacrifice shows still more closely the religious
basis (Kultusgrundlage) of the myth. Here also,
as in the former, we have to do with a Colhua.
The Aztecs offered the Colhua king to show divine
honors to his daughter and to apotheosize her into the
mother of their national god, declaring that such was
the will of the deity. The king, rejoicing at the honor
intended for his daughter, let her go, and she was
brought to Tenochtitlan with great pomp. No sooner,
however, had she arrived than she was sacrificed, flayed,
and one of the bravest youths dressed in her skin. The
king was invited to the solemn act of the deification of
his daughter, and only became aware of her death when
the flame from the copal gum revealed to him the bloody
skin about the youth placed at the side of the god. The
daughter was, however, at once formally declared mother
of Huitzilopochtli and of all the gods.</p>

<p class="sidenote">TETEIONAN.</p>

<p>This aitiological cultus-myth is easily explained.
The name of the daughter is Teteionan, whom we have
learned to know as the gods'-mother, and as Tocitzin, 'our
grandmother.'<a id="FNanchor_VIII-14" href="#Footnote_VIII-14" class="fnanchor">[VIII-14]</a> She was never the daughter of a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309">309</a></span>
human king, but has been transformed into one by euhemerism,
somewhat as Iphigenia is to be considered as
originally Artemis. The goddess Teteionan had her
special festival in Mexico, when a woman, dressed as
goddess, was sacrificed; while held on the back of another
woman, her head was cut off, then she was flayed,
and the skin carried by a youth, accompanied by a
numerous retinue, as a present to Huitzilopochtli. Four
prisoners of war were, moreover, previously sacrificed.</p>

<p>Similar to this story, told by Clavigero, is another,
narrated by Acosta. According to the latter, Tozi was
the daughter of the king of Culhuacan, and was made
the first human sacrifice by order of Huitzilopochtli, who
desired her for a sister. Tozi is, however, none other
than Tocitzin, and is also shown to be 'our grandmother.'
According to the Aztec version, the custom of dressing
priests in the skin of sacrificed beings dates from her&mdash;such
representations are often seen, especially in Humboldt;
the Bâsle collection of Mexican antiquities possesses
also the stone image of a priest dressed in a human skin.
The fourth month, Tlacaxipehualitzli, this is, 'to flay a
man,' derived its name from this custom, which is said to
have been most frequent at this period of the year.</p>

<p>Goddesses, or beings representing goddesses, are sacrificed
in both of these fables. We have met with human
sacrifices among the Muyscas in Central America, and in
connection with many deities of the Mexicans, in which
the human victim represents the god to whom he is to
be sacrificed. Slaves impersonating gods were also
sacrificed among the northern Indians, the so-called
<i>Indios bravos</i>. The person sacrificed is devoured by
the god, is given over to him, is already part of him,
is the god himself. Such was the case with the slave
that personated Quetzalcoatl in the merchants' festival
in Cholula.</p>

<p>The critic is only able to admit the relative truth of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310">310</a></span>
the recentness of the period in which the origin of Mexican
human sacrifices is placed by these three myths. We
already know that human sacrifices are very ancient in
all America, and that they have only been put aside at a
few places by humane efforts; as in Peru to some extent
by means of the Incas. We have met with them throughout
all South America.</p>

<p>The statement so generally made that the Toltec
Quetzalcoatl preached against human sacrifices, certainly
implies the previous existence of such sacrifices. This
statement about Quetzalcoatl also points out the way to
the assimilation of the varying accounts, fables, and
myths. In very ancient times human sacrifices predominated
everywhere. The Toltecs, like the Incas,
endeavored more or less to abolish them, and, even if not
altogether successful, they reduced them considerably.
The Aztecs reintroduced them. In the East Indies,
these sacrifices date back to the era before the flood, and
the Greeks there met with remains of anthropophagy,
the basis thereof.</p>

<p>Brahmanism sought to exterminate these ancient sacrifices,
and the Vedas forbid them, a prohibition which,
in connection with the custom of pretending to sacrifice
human beings, gives evidence of a former use of actual
sacrifices. The later sect of Shiwaits again introduced
them.</p>

<p>However ancient the national political phase of Huitzilopochtli
may be, the nature phase is still older.
This god, too, has a nature-basis which not only explains
his being, but throws light upon his further unfolding
as a national or war god. All searchers who do not
begin with this basis, see nothing but inexplicable riddles
and contradictions before them.</p>

<p class="sidenote">TWO MOTHERS OF HUITZILOPOCHTLI.</p>

<p>This nature-basis is first seen in the myth about his
birth. In the neighborhood of Tulla there was a place
called Coatepec, where lived a god-fearing woman,
called Coatlicue. One day, as she was going to the
temple, according to her custom, a gaily colored ball of
feathers fell down from heaven; she picked it up, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311">311</a></span>
hid it in her bosom, intending to decorate the altar
therewith. As she was on the point of producing it for
this purpose, it could not be found. A few days afterward
she was aware of being pregnant. Her children, the
Centzunhuitznahuas, also noticed this, and, in order to
avoid their own disgrace, they determined to kill her before
she was delivered. Her sorrow was however, miraculously
consoled by a voice that made itself heard from
within her womb, saying: Fear not, O mother, I will save
thee to thy great honor, and to my great fame! The
brothers, urged on by their sister, were on the point of
killing her, when, behold, even as the armed Athena
sprang from her father's head, Huitzilopochtli was born;
the shield in his left hand, the spear in his right, the
green plumage on his head, and humming-bird feathers
on his left leg; his face, arms, and legs being, moreover,
striped with blue. At once he slew his opponents,
plundered their dwellings, and brought the spoils to his
mother. From this he was called Terror and the Frightful
God.</p>

<p>If we dissect this myth, we notice that another mother
appears than the one formerly sacrificed in his honor, Teteionan.
Two mothers present nothing remarkable in
mythology, I have only to mention Aphrodite and Athena,
who according to different accounts, had different fathers.
So long as the formation of myths goes on, founded upon
fresh conceptions of nature, somewhat different ideas
(for wholly different, even here, the two mothers are
not) from distinct points of view, are always possible.
It is the anthropomorphism of the age that fixes on the
one-sided conclusion. Teteionan is Huitzilopochtli's
mother, because she is the mother of all the gods. The
mother, in this instance, is the Flora of the Aztecs, euhemerized
into a god-fearing woman, Coatlicue, or Coatlantana,
of whose worship in Coatepec and Mexico
we have already spoken.</p>

<p>The second point prominent in the myth, is the
close connection of Huitzilopochtli with the botanical
kingdom. The humming-bird is the messenger of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312">312</a></span>
spring, sent by the south to the north, by the hot to
the temperate region. It is the means of fructifying the
flowers, its movements causing the transfer of the pollen
from the stamens to the germ-shells. It sticks its
long, thin little bill deep into the flower, and rummaging
beneath the stamens, drinks the nectar of the flower,
while promoting the act of plant-reproduction. In the
Latin myth also, Mars stands in close connection with
Flora: Juno gives him birth with Flora's aid, without
the assistance of Jupiter. In our mythology of the
north, Thor is on a friendly footing with Nanna, the
northern Flora. We are already acquainted also with
a fable of the Pimas, according to which the goddess of
maize became pregnant by a raindrop, and bore the
forefather of the people, he who built the great houses.</p>

<p class="sidenote">SISTERS OF HUITZILOPOCHTLI.</p>

<p>The question, why Huitzilopochtli should be the son
of the goddess of plants, and what his real connection
with the botanical kingdom consists in, is solved by
examining his worship at the three ancient yearly feasts,
which take place exactly at those periods of the year
that are the most influential for the Mexican climate,
the middle of May, the middle of August, and the end
of December. As a rule, in the first half of May
the rain begins. Previous to this, the greatest drought
and torpidness reign; the plants appear feeble and drooping;
nature is bare, the earth gray with dry, withered
grass. After a few days of rain, however, the trees
appear in a fresh green, the ground is covered with new
herbs, all nature is reanimated. Trees, bushes, plants,
develop their blossoms; a vapory fragrance rises over all.
The fruit shoots from the cultivated field, the juicy,
bright green of the maize refreshes the eye. Mühlenpfordt,
who stayed a long time in these regions, gives this
description of the season. Völker's statement that rain
and water stand as fructifying principles in the first
rank in ancient physics, and that they meet us in innumerable
myths, holds doubly good for the tropics. It
requires little imagination to understand what a powerful
impression transformed nature, with all its beauty
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313">313</a></span>
and blessings, must produce in the soul of the child of
nature. It is on this account that the ancient Tlaloc
came to enjoy so high a regard among the Aztecs, nor
has Quetzalcoatl disdained to adorn his mantle with the
crosses of a rain-god. And so Huitzilopochtli's first feast
of the year, the festival of the arrival of the god, of the
offering of incense, stands at the beginning of the
season of the reinvigorating of nature by the rain. The
pagan Germans used to say that Nerthus, Freya, Hulda,
Bertha, Frieg, and other divinities, entered the country
at this period. The Aztecs prepared especially for this
feast an image of their chief god, made of edible plants
and honey, of the same size as the wooden image; and
the youths sang the deeds of their god before it, and
hymns praying for rain and fertility. Offering of multitudes
of quails, incense-burning, and the significant dance
of priests and virgins, followed. The virgins, who on this
day were called sisters of Huitzilopochtli, wore garlands
of dry maize-leaves on their heads, and carried split
reeds in their hands; by this representing the dry season.
The priests, on the contrary, represented the
quickened nature, having their lips smeared with honey.</p>

<p>Now although, according to Max von Wied, there were
no bees in America before the arrival of the Europeans, the
bees are here represented by humming-birds, also called
honey or bee birds, which, hovering and humming like
bees, gather their food from the tube-shaped flowers.
This food consists of a small insect that lives on honey,
and they feed their young by letting them suck at the
tongue covered with this honey. The priests bore,
further, another symbol of spring: each one held a staff
in his hand, on which a flower of feathers was fixed,
having another bunch of feathers fixed over it; thus too,
Freya's hawk-plumage denoted the advent of the fine
season. A prisoner had been selected a year in advance
as a victim, and was called 'wise lord of the heaven,' for
he personated the god, and had the privilege of choosing
the hour of the sacrifice; he did not die, like the other
prisoners, on the sacrifice stone, but on the shoulders of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314">314</a></span>
the priests. The little children were consecrated to the
god of their country, at this festival, by a small incision
on the breast.</p>

<p>So also Mars appears as god of spring, he to whom the
grass and the sacred spring time of the birth of animals
(<i>ver sacrum</i>) were dedicated, whose chief festival and
whose month are placed at the commencement of spring,
at which time the Salii also sang their old religious songs,
and a man personated the god. The Tyrian festival of
the awaking of Hercules fell also in spring, for the same
reason. Thus, in the myth of the birth of Huitzilopochtli,
and in his first festival, spring, or the energy that
produces spring, is made the basis of his being. His
warlike attributes are appendages of the anthropomorphized
national and war god.</p>

<p>The second great festival of the deity takes place in
the middle of August. The rains which have lasted
and refreshed up to this time, become intermittent, and
the fine season approaches, during which the azure sky of
the tropics pours its splendor and its beneficial warmth
upon men, animals, and plants, scattered over a plain
situated 8500 feet above the level of the sea. This is
the twelfth month there, the month of ripe fruits. The
idols in all temples and dwellings are decorated with
flowers. It is now no longer the rain which is the blessing,
but the blue sky which cherishes the variegated
flower-world. For this reason the image of Huitzilopochtli
was blue, his head was wound round with an azure
ribbon, in his right hand he held an azure staff or club,
and he sat on an azure stool, which, according to ancient
accounts, represents heaven as his dwelling-place. His
arms and legs had also blue stripes, and costly blue
stones hung round his neck. The Egyptian god of fertility,
Khem, was also represented in blue.</p>

<p class="sidenote">DEATH OF VEGETATION.</p>

<p>The third festival of Huitzilopochtli takes place during
the winter solstice, a period which plays a great rôle
in all worships and myths. The best-known festival of
this kind is the one held on the 25th of December
throughout the Roman Empire, to celebrate the birth of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315">315</a></span>
Mithras, the invincible sun. The Chipewas in North
America call December the month of the small spirit,
and January that of the great spirit. The Mexican festival
of this month represented the character of the entering
season, and the new state of nature. The cold sets
in, the mountains are covered with snow, the ground
dries up, the plants search in vain for their nourishment,
many trees lose their foliage&mdash;in a word, nature seems
dead. And so it happened with their god. The priests
prepared his image of various seeds kneaded with the
blood of sacrificed children. Numerous religious purifyings
and penances, washings with water, blood-lettings,
fasts, processions, burning of incense, sacrifices of quails
and human beings, inaugurated the festival. One of
Quetzalcoatl's priests then shot an arrow at this image
of Huitzilopochtli, which penetrated the god who was
now considered as dead. His heart was cut out, as
with human victims, and eaten by the king, the representative
of the god on earth. The body, however, was
divided among the various quarters of the city, so that
every man received a piece. This was called <i>teoqualo</i> 'the
god who is eaten.'</p>

<p>The meaning of the death of this god is, on the whole,
evident; it corresponds with the death of vegetation; and
a comparison of the myth of his birth, with the two
other feasts of Huitzilopochtli, leads to the same conclusion.
This third feast is, therefore, at the same time, a
festival in honor of the brother of this god, Tezcatlipoca,
the god of the under-world, of death, of drought, and of
hunger, whose rule commences where that of his brother
ends. The myth gives a similar form and sense to the
death of Osiris, who is killed by Typhon, and the death
of Dionysos and Hercules in the Ph&oelig;nician colonies.
Adonis lives with Aphrodite during one half of the year,
and with Persephone the other half; the Indian Krishna
leaves for the under-world; thus, too, Brahma and the
Celtic sun-god, Hu, died yearly, and were yearly born
again. The festival of the self-burning of the Tyrian
Heracles is also of this kind; it takes place at the time
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316">316</a></span>
of the dying off of vegetation, even if this should be in
the summer.</p>

<p>As regards the custom of eating the god, this also
occurs at another feast which is celebrated during this
season, in honor of the gods of the mountains and the
water. Small idols of seeds and dough were then prepared,
their breasts were opened like those of human victims,
the heart was cut out, and the body distributed for
eating. The time at which this occurs, shows that it
stands in necessary connection with the death of the god.
When the god dies it must be as a sacrifice in the fashion
of his religion, and when the anthropomorphized god
dies, it is as a human sacrifice amid all the necessary
usages pertaining thereto: he is killed by priests, the
heart is torn out, and his body eaten at the sacrifice
meal, just as was done with every human sacrifice.
Could it be meant that the god, in being eaten, is imparted
to, or incorporated with, the person eating him?
This is no doubt so, though not in the abstract, metaphysical,
Christian or moral sense, but only with regard
to his nature-sense, (seiner Naturseite), which is the real
essence of the god. He gives his body, in seed, to be
eaten by his people, just as nature, dying at the approach
of the winter, at this very period, has stored up an
abundance of its gifts for the sustenance of man. It
gives man its life-fruit, or its fruit of life as a host or
holy wafer. As a rule, the god, during the time of sacrifice,
regales with the offering those bringing sacrifices;
and, the eating of the flesh of the slave, who so often
represents the god to whom he is sacrificed, is the same
as eating the god. We have heard of the custom among
some nations of eating the ashes of their forefathers, to
whom they give divine honors, in order to become possessors
of their virtues. The Arkansas nation, west of
the Mississippi, which worshiped the dog, used to eat
dog-flesh at one of its feasts. Many other peoples
solemnly slaughter animals, consume their flesh, and
moreover pay divine honors to the remains of these animals.
Here the eating of the god, in seeds, is made
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317">317</a></span>
clear&mdash;this custom also existed among the Greeks. The
division of the year-god by the ancients, in myth and
religious system, has, for the rest, no other sense than
has this distribution of the body of Huitzilopochtli. This
is done with the sun-bull at the festival of the Persian
Mithras, as at the feast, and in the myth of the Dionysos-Zagreus,
of Osiris and Attys.</p>

<p class="sidenote">YEARLY LIFE OF THE PLANT-WORLD.</p>

<p>The three yearly festivals, as well as the myth of his
birth, all tend to show the positive connection of Huitzilopochtli
with the yearly life of the plant-world.
The first festival is the arrival of the god, as the plant-world
is ushered in, with its hymns praying for rain,
its virgins representing the sisters of the god and the
inimical drought, in the same sense as the brothers and
sister, especially the latter, are his enemies in the myth
of his birth, and, as Tezcatlipoca, the god of drought is
his brother. Brothers and sisters not seldom represent
parallel contrasts in mythology and worship. The
second celebration presents the god as the botanical
kingdom in its splendor, for which reason the Mexicans
call the humming-bird the sunbeam, from the form assumed
by the god at this time. The humming-bird,
moreover, takes also his winter sleep, and thus the god
dies in winter with the plants. The Greenlanders asked
the younger Egede if the god of heaven and earth ever
died, and, when answered in the negative, they were
much surprised, and said that he must surely be a great
god. This intimate connection with the plant-world is
also shown in the birth-myth of Huitzilopochtli, who here
appears as the son of the goddess of plants. It now becomes
easier to answer the question of Wuttke: has the
fable of this birth reference merely to the making a man
out of a god already existing, or to the actual birth
of the god? The Aztecs, it is true, were undecided on
this point, some conceding to him a human existence on
earth, others investing him with a consciousness of his
nature being. We, however, answer this question simply,
from the preceding: the birth of the god is annual, and
the myth has therefrom invented one birth, said to have
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318">318</a></span>
taken place at some period, while the anthropomorphism
fables very prettily the transformation into a man. Of
the former existence of a born god, the myth knows
nothing, for it is only afterward that it raises the god
into heaven. It has not, however, come to euhemerism
in the case of Huitzilopochtli, though it has with Huitziton.
In placing the god in the position of son to the
plant-goddess, the myth separates his being from that of
the mother, consequently, Huitzilopochtli is not the plant-world
himself, however closely he may be related to it.
This is made clearer by following up the birth-myth,
which makes him out to be not only the son of Coatlicue,
but also of the force causing her fructification. The
variegated ball of feathers which fell from heaven, is
none other than Huitzilopochtli himself, the little humming-bird,
which is the means of fructifying the plants,
and the virile, fructifying nature-force manifested by
and issuing from him in the spring. He is also born
with the feather-tuft, and this symbol of the fine season
never leaves him in any of his forms, it remains his attribute.</p>

<p>The Tapuas in South America have, after a similar
symbolism, the custom, at their yearly seed-sowing
festivals, of letting some one hang a bunch of ostrich-feathers
on his back, the feathers being spread over like
a wheel. This feather-bunch is their symbol of the fructifying
power which comes from heaven. Their belief
that bread falls from heaven into this tuft of feathers is
thus made clear. In this myth we find the natural basis
of such a birth-myth. In our northern mythology,
Neekris, the ball, is, in the same manner, the father of
Nanna, the northern Flora. That this virile power of
heaven is made to appear as a ball of feathers, suits the
humming-bird god. The Esths also imagined their god
of thunder, as the god of warmth, in the form of a bird.
In the same sense, doves were consecrated to Zeus,
in Dodona and Arcadia, and a flying bird is a symbol
of heaven among the Chinese. This force may, however,
be symbolized in another form, and give rise to a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319">319</a></span>
birth-myth of exactly the same kind. Thus, the
daughter of the god Sangarius, in the Phrygian myth,
hid in her bosom the fruit of an almond-tree, which had
grown out of the seed of the child of the earth, Agdistis:
the fruit disappeared, the daughter became pregnant and
bore the beautiful boy Attes. According to Arnobius,
it was the fruit of a pomegranate-tree, which fructified
Nanna. Among the Chinese, a nymph, called Puzza,
the nourisher of all living things, became pregnant by
eating a lotus-flower, and gave birth to a great law-giver
and conqueror. Danaë, again, becomes pregnant
from the golden shower of Zeus&mdash;an easily understood
symbolism. It is always the virile nature-power, either
as seen in the sun, or in the azure sky (for which reason
Huitzilopochtli is called the lord of the heaven, Ochibus
or Huchilobos), which puts the variegated seed into the
womb of the plant-world, 'at the same time bringing
himself forth again, and making himself manifest in the
plant-world.' This heavenly life-force no sooner finds
an earthly mother-womb than its triumph is assured, even
before birth, while developing its bud; just as the inner
voice, in the myth, consoled the mother, and protected
her against all her enemies. It is only after his birth
that the myth holds Huitzilopochtli as a personal anthropomorphic
god.</p>

<p class="sidenote">THE VIRILE NATURE-POWER.</p>

<p>This is the natural signification of Huitzilopochtli,
which we have accepted as the basis of all other developments
of the god, and for this universal reason,
namely, that the most ancient heathen gods are nature-gods,
mythologic rules being followed, and that the pagan
religion is essentially a nature-worship as well as a polytheism.
The special investigation and following up of
the various virtues have led to the same result. But,
as this view has not yet been generally accepted in regard
to this god, a few words concerning the union of
the anthropomorphic national aspect of Huitzilopochtli,
with his natural one may be added. It has been thought
necessary to make the martial phase of Huitzilopochtli
the basis of the others, as with Mars. War is, from
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320">320</a></span>
this point of view, a child of spring, because weapons
are then resumed after the long winter armistice. This
is not at all the case with Huitzilopochtli, because the
rainy season, setting in in spring, when the arrival and
birth of the god are celebrated, renders the soft roads of
Mexico unsuitable for war expeditions. Wars were
originally children of autumn, at which time the ripe
fruits were objects of robbery. But the idea of a war
and national god is easily connected with the basis of a
fructifying god of heaven. This chief nature-god may
either be god of heaven, as Huitzilopochtli, as the rain-giving
Zeus is made the national god by Homer, to
whom human sacrifices were brought in Arcadia down
to a late period, or he may be a sun-god, like Baal, to
whom prayers for rain were addressed in Ph&oelig;nicia, to
further the growth of the fruit, and who also received
human sacrifices. The Celtic Hu is also an ethereal
war god, properly sun-god, who received human sacrifices
in honor of the victory of spring; none the less is
Odin's connection with war, battle, and war horrors; he
is a fire-god, like Moloch and Shiva, to whom human
sacrifices were made for fear of famine and failure of
crops. The apparent basis of such a god has not to be
considered so much as the point that the people ascribed
to him the chief government of the course of the year. In
such a case, the chief ruler also becomes the national god,
the life of the nation depending immediately on the
yearly course of nature. Is the nation warlike, then, the
national god naturally becomes a war god as well. As
anthropomorphism connects itself with the nature-god
only at a later period, so does his worship as war god
and national god. In the case of Mars, as well as of
Picus and Faunus, the same succession is followed.
Mars, for example, is called upon in a prayer which has
been preserved by Cato, to protect shepherds and flocks,
and to avert bad weather and misgrowth; Virgil refers
to him as a god of plants. In the song of the Arvalian
brothers, he is called upon as the protector of the flowers.
Thus, in his case also, the nature side is the basis. The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321">321</a></span>
Chinese symbolism of the union of the two sides or
phases, is expressed in such a manner as to make spears
and weapons representations of the germs of plants.
This union has already been illustrated among the
Aztecs, in the humming-bird, the sunbeam which plays
round the flowers, in whose little body the intensest war
spirit burns. Among the Egyptians, the beetle was
placed upon the ring of the warrior, with whom it signified
world and production.</p>

<p class="sidenote">SNAKE SYMBOLISM.</p>

<p>It remains to speak of another attribute of Huitzilopochtli,
the snake attribute. Huitzilopochtli is also a
snake-god. We have already, when treating of the
snake-worship of the Mayas, referred to the numerous
snakes with which this god is connected by myth and
image, and how this attribute was added to the original
humming-bird attribute, in Coatepec, where the snake-goddess
Coatlicue gave him birth. If the snake signifies,
in one case, time, in another, world, and in another
instance, water, or the yearly rejuvenation of germs and
blossoms, the eternal circle of nature, domination, soothsaying&mdash;it
is quite proper; for all these qualities are
found united in the god. Still other qualities, not
seemingly possessed by him, we pass over, such as a
connection with the earth and with the healing power, to
be found in other Mexican gods, or the evil principle,
which is entirely wanting. Just as the snake changes
its skin every year, and takes its winter sleep, so does
Huitzilopochtli, whose mother, Flora, is, therefore, a
snake-goddess. Even so the snake represents the seed-corn
in the mysteries of Demeter. In the Sabazii it represents
the fructifying Zeus and the blessing. It is also
the symbol of productive power and heat, or of life, attribute
of the life-endowing Shiva; among the Egyptians it
represents the yearly rejuvenation of germs and blossoms.
The snake Agathodæmon appears with ears of grain and
poppies, as the symbol of fertility. If the god exhibits
this nature of his, in spring, in the rain, then the snake
is a suitable attribute. In India, snakes are genii of
seas, and the Punjab, whose fertility is assured by the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322">322</a></span>
yearly inundations, has the name of snake lands (Nagakhanda),
and claims an ancient worship. The sustaining
water-god, Vishnu, also received the snake attribute.
Among the Chinese, the water could be represented by
a snake. The Peruvians call the boa constrictor the
mother of nature.</p>

<p>The idea of the yearly renewal of nature is also connected
with that of time forever young, and the Aztecs,
therefore, encircle their cycle with a snake as the symbol
of time. The more positive signification which
the snake, placed by the side of the humming-bird, gives
to Huitzilopochtli, is that of a soothsaying god, like the
snake Python among the Greeks. The snake signified
'king' among the Egyptians, and this suits Huitzilopochtli
also, who may properly enough be considered the
real king of his people. If, as connected with Huitzilopochtli,
the snake also represents the war god, on account
of its spirited mode of attack, I cannot with certainty
say, but the myth as well as the worship places
it in this relation to the war goddess Athene. Although
the idea of a national and a war god is not quite obscured
in the snake attribute, yet the nature side is especially
denoted by it, as in the southern countries, where snake
worship prevailed; the reference to the southern nature
of this god is quite evident in the snake attribute. In
the north, moisture, represented by the snake, has never
attained the cosmological import which it has in the hot
countries of the south. There, the snake rather represents
an anticosmogonic, or a bad principle.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-15" href="#Footnote_VIII-15" class="fnanchor">[VIII-15]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">WINTER-SOLSTICE FESTIVAL.</p>

<p>Mr Tylor, without committing himself to any extent in
details, yet agrees, as far as he goes, with Müller. He
says: "The very name of Mexico seems derived from
Mexitli, the national war-god, identical or identified
with the hideous gory Huitzilopochtli. Not to attempt
a general solution of the enigmatic nature of this inextricable
compound parthenogenetic deity, we may notice
the association of his principal festival with the winter solstice,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323">323</a></span>
when his paste idol was shot through with an
arrow, and being thus killed, was divided into morsels
and eaten, wherefore the ceremony was called the <i>teoqualo</i>,
or 'god-eating.' This, and other details, tend to
show Huitzilopochtli as originally a nature-deity, whose
life and death were connected with the year's, while his
functions of war-god may be of later addition."<a id="FNanchor_VIII-16" href="#Footnote_VIII-16" class="fnanchor">[VIII-16]</a></p>

<p>Of this festival of the winter solstice the date and
further particulars are given by the Vatican Codex as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The name Panquetzaliztli, of the Mexican month that
began on the first of December, means, being interpreted,
'the elevation of banners.' For, on the first day of December
every person raised over his house a small paper
flag in honor of this god of battle; and the captains and
soldiers sacrificed those that they had taken prisoners in
war, who, before they were sacrificed, being set at
liberty, and presented with arms equal to their adversaries,
were allowed to defend themselves till they
were either vanquished or killed, and thus sacrificed.
The Mexicans celebrated in this month the festival of
their first captain, Vichilopuchitl. They celebrated at
this time the festival of the wafer or cake. They made
a cake of the meal of bledos, which is called <i>tzoalli</i>, and
having made it, they spoke over it in their manner,
and broke it into pieces. These the high priest put into
certain very clean vessels, and with a thorn of maguey,
which resembles a thick needle, he took up with the
utmost reverence single morsels, and put them into the
mouth of each individual, in the manner of a communion&mdash;and
I am willing to believe that these poor
people have had the knowledge of our mode of communion
or of the preaching of the gospel; or perhaps
the devil, most envious of the honor of God, may have
led them into this superstition in order that by this
ceremony he might be adored and served as Christ our
Lord. On the twenty-first of December they celebrated
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324">324</a></span>
the festival of this god&mdash;through whose instrumentality,
they say, the earth became again visible after
it had been drowned with the waters of the deluge: they
therefore kept his festival during the twenty following
days, in which they offered sacrifices to him.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-17" href="#Footnote_VIII-17" class="fnanchor">[VIII-17]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">DECORATIONS OF TLALOC.</p>

<p>The deity Tlaloc, or Tlalocateuchtli, whom we have
several times found mentioned as seated beside Huitzilopochtli
in the great temple, was the god of water and
rain, and the fertilizer of the earth. He was held
to reside where the clouds gather, upon the highest
mountain-tops, especially upon those of Tlaloc, Tlascala,
and Toluca, and his attributes were the thunderbolt, the
flash, and the thunder. It was also believed that in
the high hills there resided other gods, subaltern to
Tlaloc&mdash;all passing under the same name, and revered
not only as gods of water but also as gods of mountains.
The prominent colors of the image of Tlaloc were
azure and green, thereby symbolizing the various shades
of water. The decorations of this image varied a good
deal according to locality and the several fancies of
different worshipers: the description of Gama, founded
on the inspection of original works of Mexican religious
art, is the most authentic and complete. In the great
temple of Mexico, in his own proper chapel, called <i>epeoatl</i>,
adjoining that of Huitzilopochtli, this god of water
stood upon his pedestal. In his left hand was a shield
ornamented with feathers; in his right were certain
thin, shining, wavy sheets of gold representing his
thunderbolts, or sometimes a golden serpent representing
either the thunderbolt or the moisture with which
this deity was so intimately connected. On his feet were
a kind of half-boots, with little bells of gold hanging therefrom.
Round his neck was a band or collar set with
gold and gems of price; while from his wrists depended
strings of costly stones, even such as are the ornaments of
kings. His vesture was an azure smock reaching to the
middle of the thigh, cross-hatched all over with ribbons
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325">325</a></span>
of silver forming squares; and in the middle of each
square was a circle also of silver, while in the angles
thereof were flowers, pearl-colored, with yellow leaves
hanging down. And even as the decoration of the vesture
so was that of the shield; the ground blue, covered
with crossed ribbons of silver and circles of silver: and
the feathers of yellow and green and flesh-color and
blue, each color forming a distinct band. The body was
naked from mid-thigh down, and of a grey tint, as was
also the face. This face had only one eye of a somewhat
extraordinary character: there was an exterior circle of
blue, the interior was white with a black line across it
and a little semi-circle below the line. Either round
the whole eye or round the mouth was a doubled band,
or ribbon of blue; this, although unnoticed by Torquemada,
is affirmed by Gama to have been never omitted
from any figure of Tlaloc, to have been his most characteristic
device, and that which distinguished him specially
from the other gods. In his open mouth were to be
seen only three grinders; his front teeth were painted
red, as was also the pendant, with its button of gold,
that hung from his ear. His head-adornment was an
open crown, covered in its circumference with white and
green feathers, and from behind it over the shoulder
depended other plumes of red and white. Sometimes
the insignium of the thunderbolt is omitted with this
god, and Ixtlilxochitl represents him, in the picture of
the month Etzalli, with a cane of maize in the one hand,
and in the other a kind of instrument with which he
was digging in the ground. In the ground thus dug were
put maize leaves filled with a kind of food, like fritters,
called <i>etzalli</i>; from this the month took its name.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-18" href="#Footnote_VIII-18" class="fnanchor">[VIII-18]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">PRAYER TO TLALOC.</p>

<p class="sidenote">PRAYER FOR RAIN.</p>

<p>A prayer to this god has been preserved by Sahagun,
in which it will be noticed that the word Tlaloc is used
sometimes in the singular and sometimes in the plural:&mdash;</p>

<p>O our Lord, most clement, liberal giver and lord of
verdure and coolness, lord of the terrestrial paradise,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326">326</a></span>
odorous and flowery, and lord of the incense of copal, woe
are we that the gods of water, thy subjects, have hid
themselves away in their retreat, who are wont to serve
us with the things we need and who are themselves
served with <i>ulli</i> and <i>auchtli</i> and copal. They have left
concealed all the things that sustain our lives, and
carried away with them their sister the goddess of the
necessaries of life, and carried away also the goddess of
pepper. O our Lord, take pity on us that live; our food
goes to destruction, is lost, is dried up; for lack of water,
it is as if turned to dust and mixed with spiders' webs.
Woe for the miserable laborers and for the common
people; they are wasted with hunger, they go about unrecognizable
and disfigured every one. They are blue
under the eyes as with death; their mouths are dry as
sedge; all the bones of their bodies may be counted
as in a skeleton. The children are disfigured and yellow
as earth; not only those that begin to walk, but even
those in the cradle. There is no one to whom this torment
of hunger does not come; the very animals and
birds suffer hard want, by the drought that is. It is
pitiful to see the birds, some dragging themselves along
with drooping wings, others falling down utterly and unable
to walk, and others still with their mouths open
through this hunger and thirst. The animals, O our
Lord, it is a grievous sight to see them stumbling and
falling, licking the earth for hunger, and panting with
open mouth and hanging tongue. The people lose their
senses and die for thirst; they perish, none is like to remain.
It is woeful, O our Lord, to see all the face of
the earth dry, so that it cannot produce the herbs nor
the trees, nor anything to sustain us&mdash;the earth that
used to be as a father and mother to us, giving us milk
and all nourishment, herbs and fruits that therein grew.
Now is all dry, all lost; it is evident that the Tlaloc
gods have carried all away with them, and hid in
their retreat, which is the terrestrial paradise. The
things, O Lord, that thou wert graciously wont to give
us, upon which we lived and were joyful, which are the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327">327</a></span>
life and joy of all the world, and precious as emeralds
or sapphires&mdash;all these things are departed from us.
O our Lord, god of nourishment and giver thereof, most
humane and most compassionate, what thing hast thou
determined to do with us? Hast thou, peradventure
altogether forsaken us? Thy wrath and indignation
shall it not be appeased? Hast thou determined on the
perdition of all thy servants and vassals, and that thy
city and kingdom shall be left desolate and uninhabited?
Peradventure, this has been determined, and settled in
heaven and hades. O our Lord, concede at least this,
that the innocent children, who cannot so much as walk,
who are still in the cradle, may have something to eat, so
that they may live, and not die in this so great famine.
What have they done that they should be tormented and
should die of hunger? No iniquity have they committed,
neither know they what thing it is to sin; they have
neither offended the god of heaven nor the god of hell.
We, if we have offended in many things, if our sins have
reached heaven and hades, and the stink thereof gone
out to the ends of the earth, just it is that we be destroyed
and made an end of; we have nothing to say
thereto, nor to excuse ourselves withal, nor to resist
what is determined against us in heaven and in hades.
Let it be done; destroy us all, and that swiftly, that we
may not suffer from this long weariness which is worse
than if we burned in fire. Certainly it is a horrible
thing to suffer this hunger; it is like a snake lacking
food, it gulps down its saliva, it hisses, it cries out for
something to devour. It is a fearful thing to see the
anguish of it demanding somewhat to eat; this hunger
is intense as burning fire, flinging out sparks. Lord,
let the thing happen that many years ago we have heard
said by the old men and women that have passed away
from us, let the heavens fall on us and the demons of
the air come down, the Izitzimites, who are to come to
destroy the earth with all that dwell on it; let darkness
and obscurity cover the whole world, and the habitation
of men be nowhere found therein. This thing was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328">328</a></span>
known to the ancients, and they divulged it, and from
mouth to mouth it has come down to us, all this that
has to happen when the world ends and the earth is
weary of producing creatures. Our Lord, such present
end would be now dear to us as riches or pleasures once
were&mdash;miserable that we are! See good, O Lord, that
there fall some pestilence to end us quickly. Such
plague usually comes from the god of hades; and if it
came there would peradventure be provided some allowance
of food, so that the dead should not travel to hades
without any provision for the way. O that this tribulation
were of war, which is originated by the sun, and
which breaks from sleep like a strong and valiant one&mdash;for
then would the soldiers and the brave, the stout
and warlike men, take pleasure therein. In it many
die, and much blood is spilt, and the battle-field is filled
with dead bodies and with the bones and skulls of the
vanquished; strewn also is the face of the earth with
the hairs of the head of warriors that rot; but this they
fear not, for they know that their souls go to the house
of the sun. And there they honor the sun with joyful
voices, and suck the various flowers with great delight;
there all the stout and valiant ones that died in war are
glorified and extolled; there also the little and tender
children that die in war are presented to the Sun, very
clean and well adorned and shining like precious stones.
Thy sister, the goddess of food, provides for those
that go thither, supplying them with provision for the
way; and this provision of necessary things is the
strength and the soul and the staff of all the people of
the world, and without it there is no life. But this
hunger with which we are afflicted, O our most humane
Lord, is so sore and intolerable that the miserable common
people are not able to suffer nor support it; being
still alive they die many deaths; and not the people
alone suffer but also all the animals. O our most
compassionate Lord, lord of green things and gums,
of herbs odorous and virtuous, I beseech thee to look
with eyes of pity on the people of this thy city and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329">329</a></span>
kingdom; for the whole world down to the very
beasts is in peril of destruction, and disappearance,
and irremediable end. Since this is so, I entreat
thee to see good to send back to us the food-giving
gods, gods of the rain and storm, of the herbs and of
the trees; so that they perform again their office here
with us on the earth. Scatter the riches and the prosperity
of thy treasures, let the timbrels of joy be shaken
that are the staves of the gods of water, let them take
their sandals of india-rubber that they may walk with
swiftness. Give succor, O Lord, to our lord, the god
of the earth, at least with one shower of water, for
when he has water he creates and sustains us. See
good, O Lord, to invigorate the corn, and the other foods,
much wished for and much needed, now sown and
planted; for the ridges of the earth suffer sore need and
anguish from lack of water. See good, O Lord, that
the people receive this favor and mercy at thine hand,
let them see and enjoy of the verdure and coolness that
are as precious stones; see good that the fruit and the
substance of the Tlalocs be given, which are the clouds
that these gods carry with them and that sow the rain
about us. See good, O Lord, that the animals and
herbs be made glad, and that the fowls and birds of
precious feather, such as the <i>quechotl</i> and the <i>caguan</i>,
fly and sing and suck the herbs and flowers. And let
not this come about with thunderings and lightnings,
symbols of thy wrath; for if our lords the Tlalocs come
with thunder and lightning the whole people, being lean
and very weak with hunger, would be terrified. If indeed
some are already marked out to go to the earthly
paradise by the stroke of the thunderbolt, let this death
be restricted to them, and let no injury befall any of
the other people in mountain or cabin; neither let hurt
come near the magueys or the other trees and plants of
the earth; for these things are necessary to the life and
sustenance of the people, poor, forsaken, and cast-away,
who can with difficulty get food enough to live, going
about through hunger with the bowels empty and sticking
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330">330</a></span>
to the ribs. O our Lord, most compassionate, most
generous, giver of all nourishment, be pleased to bless
the earth and all the things that live on the face thereof.
With deep sighing and with anguish of heart I cry upon
all those that are gods of water, that are in the four
quarters of the world, east and west, north and south,
and upon those that dwell in the hollow of the earth, or
in the air, or in the high mountains, or in the deep
caves, I beseech them to come and console this poor
people and to water the earth; for the eyes of all that
inhabit the earth, animals as well as men, are turned
toward you, and their hope is set upon your persons. O
our Lord, be pleased to come.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-19" href="#Footnote_VIII-19" class="fnanchor">[VIII-19]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">VENGEANCE OF TLALOC.</p>

<p>This is a prayer to Tlaloc. But it was not with
prayers alone that they deprecated his wrath and implored
his assistance; here as elsewhere in the Mexican
religion sacrifices played an important part. When the
rain failed and the land was parched by drought, great
processions were made in which a number of hairless
dogs, common to the country, and good to eat, were
carried on decorated litters to a place devoted to this
use. There they were sacrificed to the god of water by
cutting out their hearts. Afterwards the carcasses were
eaten amid great festivities. All these things the Tlascaltec
historian, Camargo, had seen with his own eyes
thirty years before writing his book. The sacrifices of
men, which were added to these in the days of greatness
of the old religion, he describes as he was informed
by priests who had officiated thereat. Two festivals in
the year were celebrated to Tlaloc, the greater feast and
the less. Each of these was terminated by human sacrifices.
The side of the victim was opened with a sharp
knife; the high priest tore out the heart, and turning
toward the east offered it with lifted hands to the sun,
crushing it at the same time with all his strength. He
repeated this, turning in succession towards the remaining
three cardinal points; the other <i>tlamacaxques</i>, or
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331">331</a></span>
priests, not ceasing the while to darken with clouds of
incense the faces of the idols. The heart was lastly
burned and the body flung down the steps of the temple.
A priest, who had afterwards been converted to Christianity,
told Camargo that when he tore out the heart of
a victim and flung it down, it used to palpitate with such
force as to clear itself of the ground several times till it grew
cold. Tlaloc was held in exceeding respect and the priests
alone had the right to enter his temple. Whoever dared
to blaspheme against him was supposed to die suddenly or
to be stricken of thunder; the thunderbolt, instrument of
his vengeance, flashed from the sky even at the moment
it was clearest. The sacrifices offered to him in
times of drought were never without answer and result;
for, as Camargo craftily insinuates, the priests took good
care never to undertake them till they saw indications
of coming rain; besides, he adds&mdash;introducing, in defiance
of <i>nec deus intersit</i>, a surely unneeded personage,
if we suppose his last statement true&mdash;the devil,
to confirm these people in their errors, was always sure
to send rain.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-20" href="#Footnote_VIII-20" class="fnanchor">[VIII-20]</a></p>

<p>Children were also sacrificed to Tlaloc. Says Motolinia,
when four years came together in which there
was no rain, and there remained as a consequence hardly
any green thing in the fields, the people waited till the
maize grew as high as the knee, and then made a general
subscription with which four slave children, of five
or six years of age, were purchased. These they sacrificed
in a cruel manner by closing them up in a cave,
which was never opened except on these occasions.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-21" href="#Footnote_VIII-21" class="fnanchor">[VIII-21]</a></p>

<p>According to Mendieta, again, children were sometimes
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332">332</a></span>
offered to this god by drowning. The children
were put into a canoe which was carried to a certain part
of the lake of Mexico where was a whirlpool, which is
no longer visible. Here the boat was sunk with its
living cargo. These gods had, according to the same
author, altars in the neighborhood of pools especially
near springs; which altars were furnished with some
kind of roof, and at the principal fountains were four
in number set over against each other in the shape of a
cross&mdash;the cross of the rain god.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-22" href="#Footnote_VIII-22" class="fnanchor">[VIII-22]</a></p>

<p>The Vatican Codex says that in April a boy was
sacrificed to Tlaloc and his dead body put into the maize
granaries or maize fields&mdash;it is not clearly apparent which&mdash;to
preserve the food of the people from spoiling.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-23" href="#Footnote_VIII-23" class="fnanchor">[VIII-23]</a> It
is to Sahagun, however, that we must turn for the most
complete and authentic account of the festivals of Tlaloc
with their attendant sacrifices.</p>

<p class="sidenote">SACRIFICES OF CHILDREN.</p>

<p>In the first days of the first month of the year, which
month is called in some parts of Mexico, Quavitleloa,
but generally Atlcaoalo, and begins on the second of our
February, a great feast was made in honor of the Tlalocs,
gods of rain and water. For this occasion many children
at the breast were purchased from their mothers;
those being chosen that had two whirls (remolinos) in
their hair, and that had been born under a good
sign; it being said that such were the most agreeable
sacrifice to the storm gods, and most likely to induce
them to send rain in due season. Some of these infants
were butchered for this divine holiday on certain mountains,
and some were drowned in the lake of Mexico.
With the beginning of the festival, in every house, from
the hut to the palace, certain poles were set up and to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333">333</a></span>
these were attached strips of the paper of the country,
daubed over with india-rubber gum, said strips
being called <i>amateteuitl</i>; this was considered an honor
to the water-gods. And the first place where children
were killed was Quauhtepetl, a high mountain in the
neighborhood of Tlatelulco; all infants, boys or girls,
sacrificed there were called by the name of the place,
Quauhtepetl, and were decorated with strips of paper
dyed red. The second place where children were killed
was Yoaltecatl, a high mountain near Guadalupe. The
victims were decorated with pieces of black paper, with
red lines on it, and were named after the place, Yoaltecatl.
The third death-halt was made at Tepetzingo, a
well-known hillock that rose up from the waters of
the lake opposite Tlatelulco; there they killed a little
girl, decking her with blue paper, and calling her Quetzalxoch,
for so was this hillock called by another name.
Poiauhtla, on the boundary of Tlascala, was the fourth
hill of sacrifice. Here they killed children, named as
usual after the locality, and decorated with paper on
which were lines of india-rubber oil. The fifth place of
sacrifice was the no longer visible whirlpool or sink of
the lake of Mexico, Pantitlan. Those drowned here
were called Epcoatl, and their adornment <i>epuepaniuhqui</i>.
The sixth hill of death was Cocotl,<a id="FNanchor_VIII-24" href="#Footnote_VIII-24" class="fnanchor">[VIII-24]</a> near Chalcoatenco;
the infant victims were named after it and decorated
with strips of paper of which half the number were red
and half a tawny color. The mount Yiauhqueme, near
Atlacuioaia, was the seventh station; the victims being
named after the place and adorned with paper of a tawny
color.</p>

<p>All these miserable babes before being carried to
their death were bedecked with precious stones and
rich feathers and with raiment and sandals wrought
curiously; they put upon them paper wings (as if
they were angels); they stained their faces with oil of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334">334</a></span>
india-rubber, and on the middle of each tiny cheek they
painted a round spot of white. Not able yet to walk,
the victims were carried in litters shining with jewels
and awave with plumes; flutes and trumpets bellowed
and shrilled round the little bedizened heads, all so unfortunate
in their two whirls of hair, as they passed
along; and everywhere as the litters were borne by, all
the people wept. When the procession reached the
temple near Tepetzinco, on the east, called Tozocan,
the priests rested there all night, watching and singing
songs, so that the little ones could not sleep. In the
morning the march was again resumed; if the children
wept copiously those around them were very glad, saying
it was a sign that much rain would fall; while if
they met any dropsical person on the road it was taken
for a bad omen and something that would hinder the
rain. If any of the temple ministers, or of the others
called <i>quaquavitli</i>, or of the old men, broke off from the
procession or turned back to their houses before they
came to the place where the sacrifice was done, they
were held for infamous and unworthy of any public office;
thenceforward they were called <i>mocauhque</i>, that is
to say, 'deserters.'<a id="FNanchor_VIII-25" href="#Footnote_VIII-25" class="fnanchor">[VIII-25]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">SPOLIATION OF CÆSAR FOR THE CHURCH.</p>

<p>More ludicrous than diabolical are the ceremonies of
the next feast of Tlaloc. In the sixth Aztec month, the
month Etzalqualixtli, there was held a festival in honor
of the gods of water and rain. Before the commencement
of this festival the idol priests fasted four days,
and before beginning to fast they made a procession
to a certain piece of water, near Citlaltepec, to gather
tules; for at that place these rushes grew very tall and
thick and what part of them was under water was
very white. There they pulled them up, rolled them
in bundles wrapped about with their blankets, and
so carried them back on their shoulders. Both on going
out for these rushes and on coming back with them, it
was the custom to rob anyone that was met on the road;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335">335</a></span>
and as every one knew of this custom the roads
were generally pretty clear of stragglers about this time.
No one, not even a king's officer returning to his
master with tribute, could hope to escape on such
an occasion, nor to obtain from any court or magistrate
any indemnification for loss or injury so sustained
in goods or person; and if he made any resistance to his
clerical spoilers they beat and kicked and dragged him
over the ground. When they reached the temple with
their rushes they spread them out on the ground and
plaited them, white with green, into as it were painted
mats, sewing them firm with threads of maguey-root;
of these mats they made stools, and chairs with backs.
The first day of the fast arrived, all the idol ministers
and priests retired to their apartments in the temple
buildings. There retired all those called <i>tlamacaztequioagues</i>,
that is to say, 'priests that have done feats in
war, that have captured three or four prisoners;' these
although they did not reside continually in the temple,
resorted thither at set times to fulfil their offices. There
retired also those called <i>tlamacazcayiaque</i>, that is, 'priests
that have taken one prisoner in war;' these also, although
not regular inmates of the cues, resorted thither,
when called by their duties. There retired also those
that are called <i>tlamacazquecuicanime</i>, 'priest singers,' who
resided permanently in the temple building because they
had as yet captured no one in war. Last of all those
also retired that were called <i>tlamacaztezcahoan</i>, which
means 'inferior ministers,' and those boys, like little
sacristans, who were called <i>tlamacatoton</i>, 'little ministers.'</p>

<p>Next, all the rush mats that had been made which
were called <i>aztapilpetlatl</i>, 'jaspered mats of rushes, or
mats of white and green' were spread round about
the hearths (hogares) of the temple, and the priests proceeded
to invest themselves for their offices. They
put on a kind of jacket that they had, called <i>xicolli</i>, of
painted cloth; on the left arm they put a kind of scarf,
<i>macataxtli</i>; in the left hand they took a bag of copal, and
in the right a censer, <i>temaitl</i>, which is a kind of sauce-pan
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336">336</a></span>
or frying-pan of baked clay. Then they entered into
the court-yard of the temple, took up their station in
the middle of it, put live coals into their censers, added
copal, and offered incense toward the four quarters of
the world, east, north, west, and south. This done
they emptied the coals from their incense-pans into the
great brasiers that were always burning at night in the
court, brasiers somewhat less in height than the height
of a man, and so thick that two men could with difficulty
clasp them.</p>

<p class="sidenote">BATHING IN THE FESTIVAL OF TLALOC.</p>

<p>This over, the priests returned to the temple buildings,
<i>calmecac</i>, and put off their ornaments. Then they
offered before the hearth little balls of dough, called
<i>veutelolotli</i>; each priest offering four, arranging them on
the aforementioned rush mats, and putting them down
with great care, so that they should not roll nor move;
and if the balls of any one stirred, it was the duty of
his fellows to call attention to the matter and have him
punished therefor. Some offered instead of dough four
little pies or four pods of green pepper. A careful scrutiny
was also observed to see if any one had any dirt on
his blanket, or any bit of thread or hair or feather, and
that no one should trip or fall; for in such a case he had
to be punished; and as a consequence every man took good
heed to all his steps and ways during these four days.
At the end of each day's offerings, certain old men, called
<i>quaquacuiltin</i> came, their faces dyed black, and their
heads shaved, save only the crown of the head, where
the hair was allowed to grow long, the reverse of the
custom of the Christian priests. These old men daily
collected the offerings that had been made, dividing
them among themselves. It was further the custom
with all the priests and in all the temples, while fasting
these four days, to be wakened at midnight by the blast
of horns and shells and other instruments; when all
rose up and, utterly naked, went to where were
certain thorns of maguey, cut for the purpose the day
before, and with little lancets of stone they hacked their
ears, staining the prepared thorns of maguey and besmearing
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337">337</a></span>
their faces with the blood that flowed; each
man staining maguey-thorns with his blood in number
proportioned to his devotion, some five, others more,
others less. This done all the priests went to bathe
themselves, how cold soever it might be, attended by
the music of marine shells and shrill whistles of baked
clay. Every one had a little bag strapped to his shoulders,
ornamented with tassels or strips of painted paper;
in these bags was carried a sort of herb ground fine
and made up with a kind of black dye into little longish
pellets.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-26" href="#Footnote_VIII-26" class="fnanchor">[VIII-26]</a> The general body of the priests marched
along, each one carrying a leaf of maguey in which the
thorns were stuck, as in a pincushion, which he had to
use. Before these went a priest with his censer full of
live coals and a bag of copal; and in advance of all these
walked one carrying a board on his shoulder of about a
span broad and two yards long, hollowed apparently in
some way, and filled with little rollers of wood that
rattled and sounded as the bearer went along shaking
them.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-27" href="#Footnote_VIII-27" class="fnanchor">[VIII-27]</a> All the priests took part in this procession, only
four remaining behind to take care of the temple-building,
or calmecac, which was their monastery. These four
during the absence of the others remained seated in the
calmecac and occupied themselves in devotion to the
gods, in singing and in rattling with a hollow board
of the sort mentioned above. At the piece of water
where the priests were to bathe there were four houses,
called <i>axaucalli</i>, 'fog houses,' set each toward one of the
four quarters of the compass; in the ablutions of the first
night one of these houses was occupied, on the second
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338">338</a></span>
night another, and so on through all the four nights and
four houses of the fog. Here also were four tall poles
standing up out of the water. And the unfortunate
bathers, naked from the outset as we remember, reached
this place trembling and their teeth chattering with
cold. One of their number mumbled a few words,
which being translated mean: this is the place of
snakes, the place of mosquitos, the place of ducks, and
the place of rushes. This said, all flung themselves into
the water and began to splash with their hands and
feet, making a great noise and imitating the cries of
various aquatic birds.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-28" href="#Footnote_VIII-28" class="fnanchor">[VIII-28]</a> When the bathing was over,
the naked priests took their way back accompanied by
the music of pipes and shells. Half dead with cold and
weariness they reached the temple, where drawing their
mantles over them they flung themselves down in a confused
heap on the rush mats, so often mentioned, and
slept as best they could. We are told that some talked
in their sleep, and some walked about in it, and some
snored, and some sighed in a painful manner. There
they lay in a tangled weary heap not rising till noon of
the next day.</p>

<p class="sidenote">RELIGIOUS DISCIPLINE.</p>

<p>The first thing to be done on waking was to array
themselves in their canonicals, take their censers,
and to follow an old priest called Quaquacuilti to all
the chapels and altars of the idols, incensing them.
After this they were at liberty to eat; they squatted
down in groups, and to each one was given such food as
had been sent to him from his own house; and if any one
took any of the portion of another, or even exchanged his
for that of another, he was punished for it. Punishment
also attended the dropping of any morsel while
eating, if the fault were not atoned for by a fine. After
this meal, they all went to cut down branches of a certain
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339">339</a></span>
kind called <i>acxoiatl</i>, or, where these were not to be
found, green canes instead, and to bring them to the
temple in sheaves. There they sat down, every man
with his sheaf, and waited for an arranged signal. The
signal given, every one sprang up to some appointed
part of the temple to decorate it with his boughs; and if
any one went to a place not his, or wandered from his
companions, or lagged behind them, they punished him&mdash;a
punishment only to be remitted by paying to his
accuser, within the four days of which we are now speaking,
either a hen or a blanket or a breech-clout, or, if very
poor, a ball of dough in a cup.</p>

<p>These four days over, the festival was come, and every
man began it by eating <i>etzalli</i>, a kind of maize porridge,
in his own house. For those that wished it there was
general dancing and rejoicing. Many decked themselves
out like merry-andrews and went about in parties carrying
pots, going from house to house, demanding etzalli.
They sang and danced before the door, and said, "If
you do not give me some porridge, I will knock a hole in
your house;" whereupon the etzalli was given. These
revels began at midnight and ceased at dawn. Then
indeed did the priests array themselves in all their
glory: underneath was a jacket, over that a thin transparent
mantle called <i>aiauhquemitl</i>, decorated with parrot-feathers
set cross-wise. Between the shoulders they
fastened a great round paper flower, like a shield. To
the nape of the neck they attached other flowers of
crumpled paper of a semi-circular shape; these hung
down on both sides of the head like ears. The forehead
was painted blue and over the paint was dusted powder
of marcasite. In the right hand was carried a bag made
of tiger-skin, and embroidered with little white shells
which clattered as one walked. The bag seems to have
been three-cornered; from one angle hung down the
tiger's tail, from another his two fore feet, from another
his two hind feet. It contained incense made from a
certain herb called <i>yiauhtli</i>.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-29" href="#Footnote_VIII-29" class="fnanchor">[VIII-29]</a> There went one priest
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340">340</a></span>
bearing a hollow board filled with wooden rattles, as
before described. In advance of this personage there
marched a number of others, carrying in their arms
images of the gods made of that gum that is black and
leaps, called <i>ulli</i> (india-rubber), these images were called
<i>ulteteu</i>, that is to say 'gods of ulli.' Other ministers
there were carrying in their arms lumps of copal, shaped
like sugar loaves; each pyramid having a rich feather,
called quetzal, stuck in the peak of it like a plume. In
this manner went the procession with the usual horns
and shells, and the purpose of it was to lead to punishment
those that had transgressed in any of the points
we have already discussed. The culprits were marched
along, some held by the hair at the nape of the neck,
others by the breech-clout; the boy offenders were held
by the hand, or, if very small, were carried. All these
were brought to a place called Totecco, where water was.
Here certain ceremonies were performed, paper was
burned in sacrifice, as were also the pyramids of copal
and images of ulli, incense being thrown into the fire
and other incense scattered over the rush mats with
which the place was adorned. While this was going on
those in charge of the culprits had not been idle, but
were flinging them into the water. Great was the noise,
it is said, made by the splash of one tossed in, and the
water leaped high with the shock. As any one came to
the surface or tried to scramble out he was pushed in or
pushed down again&mdash;well was it then for him who could
swim, and by long far diving keep out of the reach of
his tormentors. For the others they were so roughly
handled that they were often left for dead on the water's
edge, where their relatives would come and hang them
up by the feet to let the water they had swallowed run
out of them; a method of cure surely as bad as the
malady.</p>

<p class="sidenote">THE FOUR BALLS.</p>

<p>The shrill music struck up again and the procession
returned by the way it had come; the friends of the
punished ones carrying them. The monastery or calmecac
reached, there began another four days' fast,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341">341</a></span>
called <i>netlacacaoaliztli</i>; but in this the sharp religious etiquette
of the first four days' fast was not observed, or at
least one was not liable to be informed upon or punished
for a breach of such etiquette. The conclusion of this
fast was celebrated by feasting. Again the priests decorated
themselves in festal array. All the head was
painted blue, the face was covered with honey (miel)
mixed with a black dye. Over the shoulders were carried
the incense-bags embroidered with little white shells&mdash;bags
made of tiger-skins, as before described, for the
chief priests, and of paper painted to imitate tiger-skin
in the case of the inferior priests. Some of these
satchels were fashioned to resemble the bird called <i>atzitzicuilotl</i>,
others to resemble ducks. The priests marched
in procession to the temple, and before all marched the
priest of Tlaloc. He had on his head a crown of basketwork,
fitting close to the temples below and spreading
out above, with many plumes issuing from the middle of
it. His face was anointed with melted india-rubber
gum, black as ink, and concealed by an ugly mask with
a great nose, and a wig attached which fell as low as the
waist. All went along mumbling to themselves as if
they prayed, till they came to the cu of Tlaloc. There
they stopped and spread tule mats on the ground, and
dusted them over with powdered tule-leaves mixed with
yiauhtli incense. Upon this the acting priest placed
four round chalchiuites, like little balls; then he took a
small hook painted blue, and touched each ball with it;
and as he touched each he made a movement as if
drawing back his hand, and turned himself completely
round. He scattered more incense on the mats, then
he took the board with the rattles inside and sounded
with it&mdash;perhaps a kind of religious stage thunder in
imitation of the thunder of his god. Upon this every
one retired to his house or to his monastery and put off
his ornaments; and the unfortunates who had been
ducked were carried at last to their own dwellings for
the rest and recovery that they so sorely needed.
That night the festivities burst out with a new glory,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342">342</a></span>
the musical instruments of the cu itself were sounded,
the great drums and the shrill shells. Well watched
that night were the prisoners who were doomed to death
on the morrow. When it came they were adorned with
the trappings of the Tlaloc gods&mdash;for it was said they
were the images of these gods&mdash;and those that were
killed first were said to be the foundation of the others,
which seemed to be symbolized by those who had to die
last being made to seat themselves on those who had
been first killed.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-30" href="#Footnote_VIII-30" class="fnanchor">[VIII-30]</a></p>

<p>The slaughter over, the hearts of the victims were put
into a pot that was painted blue and stained with ulli in
four places. Together with this pot offerings were taken
of paper and feathers and precious stones and chalchiuites,
and a party set out with the whole for that part of the
lake where the whirlpool is, called Pantitlan. All who
assisted at this offering and sacrifice were provided with
a supply of the herb called <i>iztauhiatl</i>, which is something
like the incense used in Spain, and they puffed it with
their mouths over each other's faces and over the faces
of their children. This they did to hinder maggots
getting into the eyes, and also to protect against a certain
disease of the eyes called <i>exocuillo-o-alixtli</i>; some also put
this herb into their ears, and others for a certain superstition
they had held a handful of it clutched in the hand.
The party entered a great canoe belonging to the king,
furnished with green oars, or paddles, spotted with ulli,
and rowed swiftly to the place Pantitlan, where the
whirlpool was. This whirlpool was surrounded by logs
driven into the bottom of the lake like piles&mdash;probably
to keep canoes from being drawn into the sink. These
logs being reached, the priests, standing in the bows of
the royal vessel, began to play on their horns and shells.
Conspicuous among them stood their chief holding the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343">343</a></span>
pot containing the hearts; he flung them far into the
whirling hollow of water, and it is said that when the
hearts plunged in, the waters were strangely moved and
stirred into waves and foam. The precious stones were
also thrown in, and the papers of the offering were
fastened to the stakes with a number of the chalchiuites
and other stones. A priest took a censer and put four
papers called <i>telhuitl</i> into it, and burned them, offering
them toward the whirlpool; then he threw them, censer
and all, still burning into the sink. That done, the
canoe was put about and rowed to the landing of Tetamacolco,
and every one bathed there.</p>

<p>All this took place between midnight and morning,
and when the light began to break the whole body of
the priests went to bathe in the usual place. They
washed the blue paint off their heads, save only on the
forehead; and if there were any offences of any priest to
be punished he was here ducked and half drowned as
described above. Lastly all returned to their monasteries,
and the green rush mats spread there were thrown
out behind each house.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-31" href="#Footnote_VIII-31" class="fnanchor">[VIII-31]</a></p>

<p>We have given the description of two great festivals
of the Tlalocs&mdash;two being all that are mentioned by
many authorities&mdash;there still remain, however, two
other notable occasions on which they were propitiated
and honored.</p>

<p class="sidenote">IMAGES OF THE MOUNTAINS.</p>

<p>In the thirteenth month, which was called Tepeilhuitl,
and which began, according to Clavigero, on the 24th of
October, it was the custom to cut certain sticks into the
shape of snakes. Certain images as of children were also
cut out of wood, and these dolls, called <i>hecatotonti</i>, together
with the wooden snakes, were used as a foundation
or centre round which to build up little effigies of
the mountains; wherein the Tlalocs were honored as gods
of the mountains, and wherein memorial was had of
those that had been drowned, or killed by thunderbolts,
or whose bodies had been buried without cremation&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344">344</a></span>
dolls perhaps representing the bodies of these, and the
snakes the thunderbolts. Having then these wooden
dolls and snakes as a basis, they were covered with dough
mixed from the seeds of the wild amaranth; over each
doll certain papers were put; round one snake and one
doll, set back to back, there appears next to have been
bound a wisp of hay, (which wisp was kept from year to
year and washed on the vigil of every feast), till the
proper shape of a mountain was arrived at; over the
whole was then daubed a layer of dough, of the kind
already mentioned. We have now our image of the
mountain with two heads looking opposite ways, sticking
out from its summit. Round this summit there
seem to have been stuck rolls of dough representing the
clouds usually formed about the crests of high mountains.
The face of the human image that looked out over these
dough clouds was daubed with melted ulli; and to both
cheeks of it were stuck little tortillas, or cakes of the
everywhere-present dough of wild amaranth seeds. On
the head of this same image was put a crown with feathers
issuing from it.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-32" href="#Footnote_VIII-32" class="fnanchor">[VIII-32]</a> These images were made at night,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345">345</a></span>
and in the morning they were carried to their 'oratories,'
and laid down on beds of rushes or reeds; then food was
offered to them, small pies or tarts, a porridge of maize-flour
and sugar, and the stewed flesh of fowls or of dogs.
Incense was burned before them, being thrown into a
censer shaped like a hand, as it were a great spoon full of
burning coals. Those who could afford it sang and
drank pulque in honor of their dead ones and of these
gods.</p>

<p class="sidenote">SACRIFICES TO TLALOC.</p>

<p>In this feast four women and a man were killed in
honor of the Tlalocs and of the mountains. The four
women were named respectively, Tepoxch, Matlalquac,
Xochetecatl, and Mayavel&mdash;this last was decorated to
appear as the image of the magueyes. The man was
called Milnaoatl; he stood for an image of 'the snakes.'
These victims, adorned with crowns of paper stained with
ulli, were borne to their doom in litters. Being carried
to the summit of the cu, they were thrown one by one
on the sacrificial stone, their hearts taken out with the
flint and offered to Tlaloc, and their bodies allowed to
slide slowly down the temple-steps to the earth&mdash;a too
rapid descent being hindered by the priests. The
corpses were carried to a place where the heads were
cut off and preserved, spitted on poles thrust through
the temples of each skull. The bodies were lastly
carried to the wards from which they had set out alive,
and there cut in pieces and eaten. At the same time
the images of the mountains, which we have attempted
to describe, were broken up, the dough with which
they were covered was set out to dry in the sun, and
was eaten, every day a piece. The papers with which
the said images had been adorned were then spread
over the wisps of hay, above mentioned, and the
whole was fastened up in the rafters of the oratory that
every one had in his house; there to remain till required
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346">346</a></span>
for the next year's feast of the same kind; on which
occasion, and as a preliminary to the other ceremonies
which we have already described in the first part of this
feast, the people took down the paper and the wisp from
their private oratories, and carried them to the public

with the wisp to make of it anew the image of a

<p class="sidenote">KILLING IMAGES OF THE MOUNTAINS.</p>

<p>The fourth and last festival of Tlaloc which we
have to describe, fell in our December and in the sixteenth
Aztec month, called the month Atemuztli. About
this time it began to thunder round the mountain-tops,
and the first rains to fall there; the common people said,
"Now come the Tlalocs," and for love of the water they
made vows to make images of the mountains&mdash;not, however,
as it would appear, such images as have been described
as appertaining to the preceding festival. The
priests were very devout at this season and very earnest
in prayer, expecting the rain. They took each man his
incense-pan or censer, made like a great spoon with a
long round hollow handle filled with rattles and terminating
in a snake's head, and offered incense to all the
idols. Five days before the beginning of the feast the
common people bought paper and ulli and flint knives
and a kind of coarse cloth called <i>nequen</i>, and devoutly
prepared themselves with fasting and penance to make
their images of the mountains and to cover them with
paper. In this holy season, although every one bathed,
he washed no higher than the neck, the head was left
unwashed; the men, moreover, abstained from their
wives. The night preceding the great feast-day was
spent wholly, flint knife in hand, cutting out paper into
various shapes. These papers called <i>tetevitl</i>, were stained
with ulli; and every householder got a long pole, covered
it with pieces of this paper, and set it up in his court-yard,
where it remained all the day of the festival.
Those that had vowed to make images of the mountains
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347">347</a></span>
invited priests to their houses to do it for them. The
priests came, bearing their drums and rattles and instruments
of music of tortoise-shell. They made the images&mdash;apparently
like human figures&mdash;out of the dough of
wild amaranth seed, and covered them with paper. In
some houses there were made five of such images, in
others ten, in others fifteen; they were figures that stood
for such mountains as the clouds gather round, such as
the volcano of the Sierra Nevada or that of the Sierra of
Tlascala. These images being constructed, they were
set in order in the oratory of the house, and before each
one was set food&mdash;very small pies, on small platters, proportionate
to the little image, small boxes holding a little
sweet porridge of maize, little calabashes of cacao, and
other small green calabashes containing pulque. In one
night they presented the figures with food in this manner
four times. All the night too they sang before them,
and played upon flutes; the regular flutists not being
employed on this occasion, but certain small boys who
were paid for their trouble with something to eat. When
the morning came, the ministers of the idols asked the
master of the house for his <i>tzotzopaztli</i>, a kind of broad
wooden knife used in weaving,<a id="FNanchor_VIII-34" href="#Footnote_VIII-34" class="fnanchor">[VIII-34]</a> and thrust it into the
breasts of the images of the mountains, as if they were
living men, and cut their throats and drew out the hearts,
which they put in a green cup and gave to the owner of
the house. This done, they took all the paper with
which these images had been adorned, together with
certain green mats that had been used for the same purpose,
and the utensils in which the offering of food had
been put, and burned all in the court-yard of the house.
The ashes and the mutilated images seem then to have
been carried to a public oratory called Aiauhcalco, on
the shore of the lake. Then all who assisted at these
ceremonies joined themselves to eat and drink in honor
of the mutilated images, which were called <i>tepieme</i>.
Women were allowed to join in this banquet provided
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348">348</a></span>
they brought fifteen or twenty heads of maize with them;
they received every one his or her share of food and
pulque. The pulque was kept in black jars and lifted out
to be drunk with black cups. This banquet over, the
paper streamers were taken down from the poles set up
in the court-yards of the houses and carried to certain
places in the water that were marked out by piles driven
in&mdash;we may remember that our whirlpool of Pantitlan,
in the lake of Mexico, was one place so marked&mdash;and
to the tops of the mountains, and left there as it would
appear.<a id="FNanchor_VIII-35" href="#Footnote_VIII-35" class="fnanchor">[VIII-35]</a></p>

<p>In taking leave here of Tlaloc I may draw attention
to the prominence in his cult of the number four, the
cross, and the snake; and add that as lord of one of the
three Aztec divisions of the future world, lord of the
terrestrial paradise, we shall meet with him again in
our examination of the Mexican ideas of a future life.</p>

<p>Centeotl is a goddess, or according to some good authorities
a god, who held, under many names and in many
characters, a most important place in the divine world of
the Aztecs, and of other Mexican and Central American
peoples. She was goddess of maize, and consequently,
from the importance in America of this grain, of agriculture,
and of the producing earth generally. Many of her
various names seem dependent on the varying aspects of
the maize at different stages of its growth; others seem to
have originated in the mother-like nourishing qualities
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350">350</a></span>
of the grain of which she was the deity. Müller lays
much stress on this aspect of her character: "The force
which sustains life must also have created it. Centeotl
was therefore considered as bringing children to light,
and is represented with an infant in her arms. Nebel
gives us such a representation, and in our Mexican
museum at Basel there are many images in this form,
made of burnt clay. Where agriculture rules, there
more children are brought to mature age than among
the hunting nations, and the land revels in a large population.
No part of the world is so well adapted to
exhibit this difference as America. Centeotl is consequently
the great producer, not of children merely, she
is the great goddess, the most ancient goddess."<a id="FNanchor_IX-1" href="#Footnote_IX-1" class="fnanchor">[IX-1]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE MOTHER-NOURISHER.</p>

<p>Centeotl was known, according to Clavigero, by the
titles Tonacajohua, 'she who sustains us;' Tzinteotl,
'original goddess;' and by the further names Xilonen,
Iztacacenteotl, and Tlatlauhquicenteotl. She was further,
according to the same author, identical with Tonantzin,
'our mother,' and, according to Müller and
many Spanish authorities, either identical or closely connected
with the various deities known as Teteionan, 'the
mother of the gods,'<a id="FNanchor_IX-2" href="#Footnote_IX-2" class="fnanchor">[IX-2]</a> Cihuatcoatl, 'the snake-woman,'
Tazi or Toci or Tocitzin, 'our grandmother,' and Earth,
the universal material mother. Squier says of Tiazolteotl,
that "she is Cinteotl the goddess of maize, under
another aspect."<a id="FNanchor_IX-3" href="#Footnote_IX-3" class="fnanchor">[IX-3]</a></p>

<p>She was particularly honored by the Totonacs, with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351">351</a></span>
whom she was the chief divinity. They greatly loved
her, believing that she did not demand human victims,
but was content with flowers and fruits, the fat banana
and the yellow maize, and small animals, such as doves,
quails, and rabbits. More, they hoped that she would in
the end utterly deliver them from the cruel necessity of
such sacrifices, even to the other gods.</p>

<p>With very different feelings, as we shall soon see, did
the Mexicans proper approach this deity, making her
temples horrid with the tortured forms of human sacrifices.
It shows how deep the stain of the blood was in
the Mexican religious heart, how poisonous far the odor
of it had crept through all the senses of the Aztec soul,
when it could be believed that the great sustainer, the
yellow waving maize, the very mother of all, must be
fed upon the flesh of her own children.<a id="FNanchor_IX-4" href="#Footnote_IX-4" class="fnanchor">[IX-4]</a></p>

<p>To make comprehensible various allusions it seems
well here to sum up rapidly the characters given of certain
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352">352</a></span>
goddesses identical with or resembling in various
points this Centeotl. Chicomecoatl<a id="FNanchor_IX-5" href="#Footnote_IX-5" class="fnanchor">[IX-5]</a> was, according to
Sahagun, the Ceres of Mexico, and the goddess of provisions,
as well of what is drunk as of what is eaten. She
was represented with a crown on her head, a vase in her
right hand, and on her left arm a shield with a great
flower painted thereon; her garments and her sandals
were red.</p>

<p>The first of the Mexican goddesses was, following the
same authority, Cioacoatl, or Civacoatl, the goddess of adverse
things, such as poverty, downheartedness, and toil.
She appeared often in the guise of a great lady, wearing
such apparel as was used in the palace; she was also heard
at night in the air shouting and even roaring. Besides her
name Cioacoatl, which means 'snake-woman,' she was
known as Tonantzin, that is to say, 'our mother.' She
was arrayed in white robes, and her hair was arranged
in front, over her forehead, in little curls that crossed
each other. It was a custom with her to carry a cradle
on her shoulders, as one that carries a child in it, and
after setting it down in the market-place beside the
other women, to disappear. When this cradle was examined,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353">353</a></span>
there was found a stone knife in it, and with
this the priests slew their sacrificial victims.</p>

<p class="sidenote">MEDICINE-GODDESS.</p>

<p>The goddess of Sahagun's description most resembling
the Toci of other writers, is the one that he calls
'the mother of the gods, the heart of the earth, and
our ancestor or grandmother (abuela).' She is described
as the goddess of medicine and of medicinal
herbs, as worshiped by doctors, surgeons, blood-letters,
of those that gave herbs to produce abortions, and also
of the diviners that pronounced upon the fortune of
children according to their birth. They worshiped her
also that cast lots with grains of maize, those that augured
by looking into water in a bowl, those that cast lots with
bits of cord tied together, those that drew little worms
or maggots from the mouth or eyes, those that extracted
little stones from other parts of the body, and those that
had sweat-baths, <i>temazcallis</i>, in their houses. These last
always set the image of this goddess in the baths, calling
her Temazcalteci, that is to say, 'the grandmother of
the baths.' Her adorers made this goddess a feast every
year, buying a woman for a sacrifice, decorating this
victim with the ornaments proper to the goddess. Every
evening they danced with this unfortunate, and regaled
her delicately, praying her to eat as they would a great
lady, and amusing her in every way that she might not
weep nor be sad at the prospect of death. When the
dreadful hour did come, having slain her, together with
two others that accompanied her to death, they flayed
her; then a man clothed himself in her skin, and went
about all the city playing many pranks&mdash;by all of which
her identity with Tozi seems sufficiently clear. This
goddess was represented with the mouth and chin stained
with ulli, and a round patch of the same on her face;
on her head she had a kind of turban made of cloth
rolled round and knotted behind. In this knot were
stuck plumes which issued from it like flames, and
the ends of the cloth fell behind over the shoulders.
She wore sandals, a shirt with a kind of broad serrated
lower border, and white petticoats. In her left hand
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354">354</a></span>
she held a shield with a round plate of gold in the centre
thereof; in her right hand she held a broom.<a id="FNanchor_IX-6" href="#Footnote_IX-6" class="fnanchor">[IX-6]</a></p>

<p>The festival in which divers of the various manifestations
of the mother-goddess were honored, was held in
the beginning of the eleventh Aztec month, beginning on
the 14th of September; Centeotl, or Cinteotl, or Centeutl,
or Tzinteutl, is however represented therein as a
male and not a female.</p>

<p class="sidenote">SACRIFICE TO THE MOTHER-GODDESS.</p>

<p>Fifteen days before the commencement of the festival
those that took part in it began to dance, if dancing it
could be called, in which the feet and body were hardly
moved, and in which the time was kept by raising and
lowering the hands to the beat of the drum. This went
on for eight days, beginning in the afternoon and finishing
with the set of sun, the dancers being perfectly silent,
arranged in four lines, and each having both hands full
of flowers, cut branches and all. Some of the youths,
indeed, too restless to bear the silence, imitated with
their mouths the sound of the drum; but all were forced
to keep, as well in motion as in voice, the exactest time
and good order. On the expiration of these eight days
the medical women, both old and young, divided themselves
into two parties, and fought a kind of mock battle
before the woman that had to die in this festival, to
amuse her and keep tears away; for they held it of bad
augury if this miserable creature gave way to her grief,
and as a sign that many women had to die in childbirth.
This woman who was called for the time being,
'the image of the mother of the gods,' led in person the
first attack upon one of the two parties of fighters, being
accompanied by three old women that were to her as
mothers and never left her side, called respectively Aoa,
Tlavitezqui, and Xocuauhtli.<a id="FNanchor_IX-7" href="#Footnote_IX-7" class="fnanchor">[IX-7]</a> The fight consisted in
pelting each other with handfuls of red leaves, or leaves
of the nopal, or of yellow flowers called <i>cempoalsuchitl</i>,
the same sort as had been carried by the actors in the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355">355</a></span>
preceding dance. These women all wore girdles, to
which were suspended little gourds filled with powder
of the herb called <i>yietl</i>. When the pelting-match was
over, the woman that had to die was led back to the
house where she was guarded; and all this was repeated
during four successive days. Then the victim representing
Toci, that is to say, 'our grandmother or ancestor,'
for so was called the mother of the gods, was led for the
last time through the market-place by the medical
woman. This ceremony was called 'the farewell to the
market-place;' for never more should she see it who this
day passed through, decorated in such mournful frippery,
surrounded by the pomp of such hollow mirth. She
went sowing maize on every side as she walked, and
having passed through the market she was received by
the priests who took her to a house near the cu where
she had to be killed. There the medical women and
midwives consoled her: Daughter, be joyful and not sad,
this night thou shalt sleep with the king. Then they
adorned her with the ornaments of the goddess Toci,
striving all the while to keep the fact of her death in the
back-ground, that she might die suddenly and without
knowing it. At midnight, in darkness, not so much as
a cough breaking the silence, she was led to the holy
temple-top, and caught up swiftly on the shoulders of a
man. There was hardly a struggle; her bearer felt himself
deluged with blood, while she was beheaded with
all despatch, and flayed, still warm. The skin of the
thighs was first taken off and carried, for a purpose to be
presently revealed, to the cu of Centeotl, who was the
son of Toci. With the remainder of the skin, next
taken off, a priest clothed himself, drawing it on, it would
appear from other records, like a glove; this priest
who was a young man chosen for his bodily forces and
size, thus clothed represented Toci, the goddess herself.
The Toci priest, with this horrible jacket sticking to his
sinewy bust, then came down from the temple amid the
chanting of the singers of the cu. On each side of him
went two persons, who had made a vow to help him in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356">356</a></span>
this service, and behind came several other priests. In
front there ran a number of principal men and soldiers,
armed with besoms of blood-stained grass, who looked
back from time to time, and struck their shields as if
provoking a fight; these he pretended to pursue with
great fury, and all that saw this play (which was called
<i>cacacalli</i>) feared and trembled exceedingly. On reaching
the cu of Huitzilopochtli, the Toci priest spread out
his arms and stood like a cross before the image of the
war god; this he did four times and then went on to the
cu of Centeotl, whither, as we remember, the skin of the
thighs of the flayed woman had been sent. This skin
of the thighs another young priest, representing the god
Centeotl, son of Toci, had put on over his face like a
mask. In addition to this loathsome veil, he wore a
jacket of feathers and a hood of feathers attached to the
jacket. This hood ran out into a peak of a spiral form
falling behind; and the back-bone or spine of this spiral
resembled the comb of a cock; this hood was called <i>ytztlacoliuhqui</i>,
that is to say 'god of frost.'</p>

<p>The Toci priest and the Centeotl priest next went together
to the cu of Toci, where the first waited for
the morning (for all this already described took
place at night) to have certain trappings put on over
his horrid under-vest. When the morning broke,
amid the chanting of the singers, all the principal
men, who had been waiting below, ran with great
swiftness up the steps of the temple carrying their
offerings. Some of these principal men began to cover
the feet and the head of the Toci priest with the white
downy inner feathers of the eagle; others painted his
face red; others put on him a rather short shirt with
the figure of an eagle wrought or woven into the breast
of it, and certain painted petticoats; others beheaded
quails and offered copal. All this done quickly, these
men took their departure.</p>

<p class="sidenote">THE SKIN-BEARERS.</p>

<p>Then were brought forth and put on the Toci priest
all his rich vestures, and a kind of square crown very
wide above and ornamented with five little banners, one
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357">357</a></span>
in each corner, and in the centre one higher than the
others. All the captives that had to die were brought
out and set in line, and he took four of them one after
the other, threw them down on the sacrificial stone and
took out their hearts; the rest of the captives he handed
over to the other priests to complete the work he had
begun. After this he set out with the Centeotl priest
for the cu of the latter. In advance of these a little
way there walked a party of their devotees, called
<i>ycuexoan</i>, decorated with papers, girt for breech-clout
with twisted paper, carrying at their shoulders a
crumpled paper, round like a shield, and tassels of untwisted
cotton. On either side also there went those
that sold lime<a id="FNanchor_IX-8" href="#Footnote_IX-8" class="fnanchor">[IX-8]</a> in the market, and the medical women,
moving to the singing of the priests and the beat of
drum. Having come to the place where heads were
spitted at the cu of Centeotl, the Toci priest set one foot
on the drum and waited there for the Centeotl priest.
The two being come together it would seem that he who
represented Centeotl now set out alone, with much haste
and accompanied by many soldiers, for a place on the
enemy's frontier where there was a kind of small hut
built. There at last was deposited and left the skin of
the thighs of the sacrificed woman which had served
such ghastly use. And often, it is said, it happened,
this ceremony taking place on the border of a hostile
territory, that the enemy sallied out against the procession,
and there was fighting and many were slain.</p>

<p>After this the young man who represented the goddess
Toci was taken to the house that is called Atempan.
The king took his seat on a throne with a mat of eagle-skin
and feathers under his feet, and a tiger-skin over
the back of his seat, and there was a grand review of the
army, and a distribution from the royal treasury of
raiment, ornaments, and arms; and it was understood
that those who received such arms had to die with them
in war. This done, dancing was begun in the court-yard
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358">358</a></span>
of the temple of Toci; and all who had received
presents, as above, repaired thither. This dancing, as in
the first part of the festival, consisted for the most part
in keeping time to the beat of the drum with hands filled
with flowers; so that the whole court looked like a living
garden; and there was so much gold, for the king
and all the princes were there, that the sun flashed
through all as on water. This began at mid-day and
went on for two days. On the evening of the second
day, the priests of the goddess Chicomecoatl, clothed
with the skins of the captives that had died in a former
day, ascended a small cu called the table of Huitzilopochtli
and sowed maize of all kinds, white and yellow and
red, and calabash-seeds, upon the heads of the people
that were below. The people tried to gather up these as
they fell, and elbowed each other a good deal. The
damsels, called <i>cioatlamacazque</i>, that served the goddess
Chicomecoatl, carried each one on her shoulder, rolled in
a rich mantle, seven ears of maize, striped with melted
ulli and wrapped in white paper; their legs and arms
were decorated with feathers sprinkled over with marcasite.
These sang with the priest of their goddess.
This done, one of the priests descended from the above-mentioned
cu of Huitzilopochtli, carrying in his hand a
large basket filled with powdered chalk and feather-down,
which he set in a small chamber, or little cave, called <i>coaxalpan</i>,
between the temple-stairs and the temple itself.
This cavity was reached from below by four or five steps,
and when the basket was put down there was a general
rush of the soldiers to be first to secure some of the contents.
Every one, as he got his hands filled, with much elbowing,
returned running to the place whence he had set
out. All this time the Toci priest had been looking on,
and now he pretended to chase those that ran, while they
pelted him back with the down and powdered chalk
they had in their hands; the king himself running a
little way and pelting him like the rest. After this
fashion they all ran away from him and left him alone,
except some priests, who followed him to a place called
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359">359</a></span>
Tocititlan, when he took off the skin of the sacrificed
woman and hung it up in a little hut that was there;
taking care that its arms were stretched out, and that
the head (or, surely, the neck&mdash;for have we not read
that the head was cut off the woman on the fatal night
which terminated her life?), was turned toward the road,
or street. And this was the last of the ceremonies of
the feast of Ochpaniztli.<a id="FNanchor_IX-9" href="#Footnote_IX-9" class="fnanchor">[IX-9]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE XILONEN FESTIVAL.</p>

<p>The intimate connection of the goddess Xilonen (from
<i>xilotl</i>, a young or tender ear of maize) with Centeotl is
shown by the fact that in the cu of Centeotl was killed
the unfortunate woman who was decorated to resemble
the goddess Xilonen. The festival of Xilonen commenced
on the eleventh day of the eighth Mexican month,
which month begins on the 16th of July. The victim
was made to resemble the image of the goddess by having
her face painted yellow from the nose downward, and her
brow red. On her head was put a crown of paper with
four corners, from the centre and top of which issued
many plumes. Round her neck and over her breasts
hung strings of precious stones, and over these was put
a round medal of gold. Her garments and sandals were
curiously wrought, the latter painted with red stripes.
On her left arm was a shield, and in the right hand she
held a stick, or baton, painted yellow. The women led
her to death dancing round her, and the priests and the
principal men danced before them, sowing incense as
they went. The priest who was to act as executioner
had on his shoulders a bunch of feathers held there in
the grip of an eagle's talons, artificial; another of the
priests carried the hollow board filled with rattles, so
often mentioned. At the foot of the cu of Centeotl, this
latter stopped in front of the Xilonen woman, scattered
incense before her, and rattled with his board, waving
it from side to side. They ascended the cu, and one of
the priests caught the victim up, twisting her backwards,
her shoulders against his shoulders; on which living
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360">360</a></span>
altar her heart was cut out through her breast, and put
into a cup. After that there was more dancing, in
which the women, old and young, took part in a body by
themselves, their arms and legs decorated with red macaw
feathers, and their faces painted yellow and dusted
with marcasite. There was also a banquet of small
pies called <i>xocotamalli</i>, during which to the old men and
women license was given to drink pulque; the young,
however, being restrained from the bacchanalian part of
this enjoyment by severe and sometimes capital punishment.<a id="FNanchor_IX-10" href="#Footnote_IX-10" class="fnanchor">[IX-10]</a></p>

<p>Lastly, the intimate connection or identity of Centeotl
with the earth-mother, the all-nourisher, seems clearly
symbolized in the feast of the fourth month of the Mexicans,
which began on the 27th of April. In it they
made a festival to the god of cereals, under the name of
Centeotl, and to the goddess of provisions, called Chicomecoatl.
First they fasted four days, putting certain
rushes or water-flags beside the images of the gods, staining
the white part of the bottom of each rush with blood
drawn from their ears or legs; branches too, of the kind
called <i>acxoiatl</i>, and a kind of bed or mattress of hay
were put before the altars. A sort of porridge of maize
called <i>mazamorra</i> was also made and given to the youths.
Then all walked out into the country, and through the
maize-fields, carrying stalks of maize, and other herbs
called <i>mecoatl</i>. With these they strewed the image of
the god of cereals that every one had in his house, and
they put papers on it and food before it of various kinds;
five <i>chiquivites</i>,<a id="FNanchor_IX-11" href="#Footnote_IX-11" class="fnanchor">[IX-11]</a> or baskets, of tortillas, and on the top
of each <i>chiquivitl</i> a cooked frog, a basket of <i>chian</i><a id="FNanchor_IX-12" href="#Footnote_IX-12" class="fnanchor">[IX-12]</a> flour,
which they call <i>pinolli</i>;<a id="FNanchor_IX-13" href="#Footnote_IX-13" class="fnanchor">[IX-13]</a> and a basket of toasted maize
mixed with beans. They cut also a joint from a green
maize-stalk, stuffed the little tube with morsels of every
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361">361</a></span>
kind of the above-mentioned food, and set it carefully
on the back of the frog.<a id="FNanchor_IX-14" href="#Footnote_IX-14" class="fnanchor">[IX-14]</a> This each one did in his own
house, and in the afternoon all this offering of food was
carried to the cu of the goddess of provisions, of the goddess
Chicomecoatl, and eaten there in a general scramble,
take who take could; symbolizing one knows not what,
if not the laisser-faire and laisser-aller system of national
commisariat much advocated by many political economists,
savage and civilized.</p>

<p class="sidenote">BLESSING THE SEED-MAIZE.</p>

<p>In this festival the ears of maize that were preserved
for seed were carried in procession by virgins to a cu,
apparently the one just mentioned, but which is here
called the cu of Chicomecoatl <i>and</i> of Centeotl. The
maidens carried on their shoulders not more than seven
ears of corn apiece, sprinkled with drops of oil of ulli,
and wrapped first in papers and then in a cloth. The
legs and arms of these girls were ornamented with red
feathers, and their faces were smeared with the pitch
called <i>chapopotli</i> and sprinkled with marcasite. As they
went along in this bizarre attire, the people crowded to
see them pass, but it was forbidden to speak to them.
Sometimes indeed an irrepressible youth would break
out into words of admiration or love toward some fair
pitch-besmeared face, but his answer came sharp and
swift from one of the old women that watched the
younger, in some such fashion as this: And so thou
speakest, raw coward! thou must be speaking, eh? Think
first of performing some man's feat, and get rid of that
tail of hair at the nape of thy neck that marks the
coward and the good-for-nothing. It is not for thee to
speak here; thou art as much a woman as I am; thou
hast never come out from behind the fire! But the
young lovers of Tenochtitlan were not without insolent
springalls among them, much given to rude gibes, and
retorts like the following: Well said, my lady, I receive
this with thanks, I will do what you command me,
will take care to show myself a man; but as for you,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362">362</a></span>
I value two cacao-beans more than you and all your
lineage; put mud on your body, and scratch yourself;
fold one leg over the other and roll in the dust; see!
here is a rough stone, knock your face against it; and if
you want anything more take a red-hot coal and burn a
hole in your throat to spit through; for God's sake, hold
your peace.</p>

<p>This the young fellows said, writes Sahagun, to show
their courage; and so it went, give and take, till the
maize was carried to the cu and blessed. Then the
folk returned to their houses and sanctified maize was
put in the bottom of every granary, and it was said
that it was the heart thereof, and it remained there till
taken out for seed. These ceremonies were specially in
honor of the goddess Chicomecoatl. She supplied provisions,
she it was that had made all kinds of maize and
frijoles, and whatsover vegetables could be eaten, and all
sorts of chia; and for this they made her that festival
with offerings of food, and with songs and dances, and
with the blood of quails. All the ornaments of her attire
were bright red and curiously wrought, and in her
hands they put stalks of maize.<a id="FNanchor_IX-15" href="#Footnote_IX-15" class="fnanchor">[IX-15]</a></p>

<p>The Mexicans deified, under the name Cioapipilti,
all women that died in child-bed. There were oratories
raised to their honor in every ward that had two
streets. In such oratories, called <i>cioateucalli</i> or <i>ciateupan</i>,
there were kept images of these goddesses adorned with
certain papers called <i>amatetevitl</i>. The eighth movable
feast of the Mexican calendar was dedicated to them,
falling in the sign Cequiahuitl, in the first house; in this
feast were slain in their honor all lying in the jails under
pain of death. These goddesses were said to move
through the air at pleasure, and to appear to whom they
would of those that lived upon the earth, and sometimes
to enter into and possess them. They were accustomed
to hurt children with various infirmities, especially paralysis
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363">363</a></span>
and other sudden diseases. Their favorite haunt
on earth was the cross-roads, and, on certain days of the
year, people would not go out of their houses for fear of
meeting them. They were propitiated in their temples
and at the cross-roads by offerings of bread kneaded into
various shapes&mdash;into figures of butterflies and thunderbolts
for example&mdash;by offerings of small tamales, or
pies, and of toasted maize. Their images, besides
the papers above mentioned, were decorated by having
the face, arms, and legs painted very white; their ears
were made of gold; their hair was dressed like that of
ladies, in little curls; the shirt was painted over with
black waves; the petticoats were worked in divers colors;
the sandals were white.</p>

<p class="sidenote">THE MOTHER-GODDESS AND WOMAN IN CHILD-BED.</p>

<p>The mother-goddess, under the form of the serpent-woman,
Cioacoatl, or Ciuacoatl, or Cihuacoatl, or, lastly,
Quilaztli, seems to have been held as the patroness of
women in child-bed generally, and, especially, of those
that died there. When the delivery of a woman was
likely to be tedious and dangerous, the midwife addressed
the patient saying: Be strong, my daughter; we
can do nothing for thee. Here are present thy mother
and thy relations, but thou alone must conduct this business
to its termination. See to it, my daughter, my well-beloved,
that thou be a strong and valiant and manly
woman; be like her who first bore children, like Cioacoatl,
like Quilaztli. And if still after a day and a
night of labor the woman could not bring forth, the midwife
took her away from all other persons and brought
her into a closed room and made many prayers, calling
upon the goddess Cioacoatl, and upon the goddess Yoalticitl,<a id="FNanchor_IX-16" href="#Footnote_IX-16" class="fnanchor">[IX-16]</a>
and upon other goddesses. If, notwithstanding
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364">364</a></span>
all, however, the woman died, they gave her the title,
<i>mociaquezqui</i>, that is 'valiant woman,' and they washed
all her body, and washed with soap her head and her
hair. Her husband lifted her on his shoulders, and,
with her long hair flowing loose behind him, carried her
to the place of burial. All the old midwives accompanied
the body, marching with shields and swords, and
shouting as when soldiers close in the attack. They
had need of their weapons, for the body that they
escorted was a holy relic which many were eager to win;
and a party of youths fought with these Amazons to take
their treasure from them: this fight was no play but a
very bone-breaking earnest. The burial procession set
out at the setting of the sun and the corpse was interred
in the court-yard of the cu of the goddesses, or celestial
women called Cioapipilti. Four nights the husband
and his friends guarded the grave and four nights the
youths, or rawest and most inexperienced soldiers,
prowled like wolves about the little band. If, either
from the fighting midwives or from the night-watchers,
they succeeded in securing the body, they instantly cut
off the middle finger of the left hand and the hair of
the head; either of these things being put in one's shield,
made one fierce, brave, invincible in war, and blinded
the eyes of one's enemies. There prowled also round
the sacred tomb certain wizards, called <i>temamacpalitotique</i>,
seeking to hack off and steal the whole left arm of
the dead wife; for they held it to be of mighty potency
in their enchantments, and a thing that when they went
to a house to work their malice thereon, would wholly
take away the courage of the inmates, and dismay them
so that they could neither move hand nor foot, though
they saw all that passed.</p>

<p class="sidenote">THE HOUSE OF THE SUN.</p>

<p>The death of this woman in child-bed was mourned
by the midwives, but her parents and relations were
joyful thereat; for they said that she did not go to hades,
or the under-ground world, but to the western part of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365">365</a></span>
the House of the Sun. To the eastern part of the House of
the Sun, as the ancients said, were taken up all the
soldiers that died in war. When the sun rose in the
morning these brave men decorated themselves in their
panoply of war, and accompanied him towards the mid-heaven,
shouting and fighting, apparently in a sham or
review battle, until they reached the point of noonday,
which was called <i>nepantlatonatiuh</i>. At this point
the heroines, whose home was in the west of heaven, the
<i>mocioaquezque</i>, the valiant women, dead in child-bed, who
ranked as equal with the heroes fallen in war, met these
heroes and relieved them of their duty as guards of
honor of the sun. From noon till night, down the
western slope of light, while the forenoon escort of warriors
were scattered through all the fields and gardens of
heaven, sucking flowers till another day should call
them anew to their duty, the women, in panoply of war,
just as the men had been, and fighting like them with
clashing shields and shouts of joy, bore the sun
to his setting; carrying him on a litter of <i>quetzales</i>, or
rich feathers, called the <i>quetzal-apanecaiutl</i>. At this
setting-place of the sun the women were, in their turn,
relieved by those of the under world, who here came out
to receive him. For it was reported of old by the
ancients that when night began in the upper world the
sun began to shine through hades, and that thereupon
the dead rose up from their sleep and bore his shining
litter through their domain. At this hour too the
celestial women, released from their duty in heaven,
scattered and poured down through the air upon the
earth, where, with a touch of the dear nature that makes
the world kin, they are described as looking for spindles
to spin with, and shuttles to weave with, and all the old
furniture and implements of their house-wifely pride.
This thing, says Sahagun, "the devil wrought to deceive
withal, for very often, in the form of those women, he
appeared to their bereaved husbands, giving them petticoats
and shirts."</p>

<p>Very beautiful was the form of address before burial
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366">366</a></span>
used by the midwife to the dead woman who had taken
rank among the <i>mocioaquezque</i> or <i>mocioaquetza</i>: O woman,
strong and warlike, child well-beloved, valiant one,
beautiful and tender dove, strong hast thou been and
toil-enduring as a hero; thou hast conquered, thou hast
done as did thy mother the lady Cioacoatl, or Quilaztli.
Very valiantly hast thou fought, stoutly hast thou
handled the shield and the spear that the great mother
put in thine hand. Up with thee! break from sleep!
behold it is already day; already the red of morning
shoots through the clouds; already the swallows and all
birds are abroad. Rise, my daughter, attire thyself, go
to that good land where is the house of thy father and
mother the Sun; thither let thy sisters, the celestial
women, carry thee, they that are always joyful and
merry and filled with delight, because of the Sun with
whom they take pleasure. My tender daughter and
lady, not without sore travail hast thou gotten the glory
of this victory; a great pain and a hard penance hast
thou undergone. Well and fortunately hast thou purchased
this death. Is this, peradventure, a fruitless
death, and without great merit and honor? Nay, verily,
but one of much honor and profit. Who receives other
such great mercy, other such happy victory as thou? for
thou hast gained with thy death eternal life, a life full
of joy and delight, with the goddesses called Cioapipilti,
the celestial goddesses. Go now, my lady, my well-beloved;
little by little advance toward them; be one of
them, that they may receive thee and be always with
thee, that thou mayest rejoice and be glad in our father
and mother the Sun, and accompany him whithersoever
he wish to take pleasure. O my lady, my well-beloved
daughter, thou hast left us behind, us old people, unworthy
of such glory; thou hast torn thyself away from
thy father and mother, and departed. Not indeed of
thine own will, but thou wast called; thou didst follow
a voice that called. We must remain orphans and forlorn,
old and luckless and poor; misery will glorify itself
in us. O my lady, thou hast left us here that we
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367">367</a></span>
may go from door to door and through the streets in
poverty and sorrow; we pray thee to remember us
where thou art, and to provide for the poverty that
we here endure. The sun wearies us with his great
heat, the air with its coldness, and the frost with
its torment. All these things afflict and grieve our
miserable earthen bodies; hunger is lord over us, and
we can do nothing against it. My well-beloved, I pray
thee to visit us since thou art a valorous woman and a
lady, since thou art settled forever in the place of delight
and blessedness, there to live and be forever with our
Lord. Thou seest him with thine eyes, thou speakest to
him with thy tongue, pray to him for us, entreat him
that he favor us, and therewith we shall be at rest.<a id="FNanchor_IX-17" href="#Footnote_IX-17" class="fnanchor">[IX-17]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">CHALCHIHUITLICUE.</p>

<p class="p2">Chalchihuitlicue or Chalchiuhcyeje is described by
Clavigero as the goddess of water and the mate of Tlaloc.
She had other names relating to water in its different
states, as Apozonallotl and Acuecuejotl, which mean
the swelling and fluctuation of water; Atlacamani, or
the storms excited thereon; Ahuic and Aiauh, or its
motion, now to one side, now to the other; and Xixiquipilihui,
the alternate rising and falling of the waves.
The Tlascaltecs called her Matlalcueje, that is 'clothed
in a green robe;' and they gave the same name to the
highest mountain of Tlascala, on whose summit are found
those stormy clouds which generally burst over the city
of Puebla. To that summit the Tlascaltecs ascended
to perform their sacrifices, and offer up their prayers.
This is the very same goddess of water to whom Torquemada
gives the name of Hochiquetzal, and Boturini
that of Macuilxochiquetzalli.<a id="FNanchor_IX-18" href="#Footnote_IX-18" class="fnanchor">[IX-18]</a></p>

<p>Of the accuracy of the assertions of this last sentence
I am by no means certain; Boturini and Torquemada
both describe their goddess of water without
giving any support thereto. Boturini says that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368">368</a></span>
she was metaphorically called by the Mexicans the
goddess of the Petticoat of Precious Stones&mdash;chalchihuites,
as it would appear from other authorities,
being meant&mdash;and that she was represented with
large pools at her feet, and symbolized by certain
reeds that grow in moist places. She was particularly
honored by fishermen and others whose trade
connected them with water, and great ladies were accustomed
to dedicate to her their nuptials&mdash;probably,
as will be seen immediately, because this goddess had
much to do with certain lustral ceremonies performed
on new-born children.<a id="FNanchor_IX-19" href="#Footnote_IX-19" class="fnanchor">[IX-19]</a></p>

<p>Many names, writes Torquemada, were given to this
goddess, but that of Chalchihuitlicue was the most common
and usual; it meant to say, 'petticoat of water, of
a shade between green and blue,' that is, of the color of
the stones called chalchihuites.<a id="FNanchor_IX-20" href="#Footnote_IX-20" class="fnanchor">[IX-20]</a> She was the companion,
not the wife of Tlaloc, for indeed as our author
affirms, the Mexicans did not think so grossly of their
gods and goddesses as to marry them.<a id="FNanchor_IX-21" href="#Footnote_IX-21" class="fnanchor">[IX-21]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">IDOL OF CHALCHIHUITLICUE.</p>

<p>According to Sahagun, Chalchihuitlicue was the sister
of the Tlalocs. She was honored because she had power
over the waters of the sea and of the rivers to drown
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369">369</a></span>
those that went down to them, to raise tempests and
whirlwinds, and to cause boats to founder. They
worshiped her all those that dealt in water, that went
about selling it from canoes, or peddled jars of it in the
market. They represented this goddess as a woman,
painted her face yellow, save the forehead, which was
often blue, and hung round her neck a collar of precious
stones from which depended a medal of gold. On
her head was a crown of light blue paper, with plumes of
green feathers, and tassels that fell to the nape of her neck.
Her ear-rings were of turquoise wrought in mosaic. Her
clothing was a shirt, or upper body-garment, clear blue
petticoats with fringes from which hung marine shells,
and white sandals. In her left hand she held a shield,
and a leaf of the broad round white water-lily, called <i>atlacuezona</i>.<a id="FNanchor_IX-22" href="#Footnote_IX-22" class="fnanchor">[IX-22]</a>
In her right hand she held as a sceptre a vessel
in the shape of a cross, or of a monstrance of the Catholic
Church. This goddess, together with Chicomecoatl,
goddess of provisions, and Vixtocioatl, goddess of salt,
was held in high veneration by kings and lords, for they
said that these three supported the common people so
that they could live and multiply.<a id="FNanchor_IX-23" href="#Footnote_IX-23" class="fnanchor">[IX-23]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">TWO LUSTRATIONS OR BAPTISMS.</p>

<p>Chalchihuitlicue was especially connected with certain
ceremonies of lustration of children, resembling in many
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370">370</a></span>
points baptism among Christians. It would seem that
two of these lustrations were practiced upon every infant,
and the first took place immediately upon its birth.
When the midwife had cut the umbilical cord of the
child, then she washed it, and while washing it said,
varying her address according to its sex: My son, approach
now thy mother, Chalchihuitlicue, the goddess of
water; may she see good to receive thee, to wash thee,
and to put away from thee the filthiness that thou takest
from thy father and mother; may she see good to purify
thine heart, to make it good and clean, and to instill
into thee good habits and manners.</p>

<p>Then the midwife turned to the water itself and spoke:
Most compassionate lady, Chalchihuitlicue, here has come
into the world this thy servant, sent hither by our
father and mother, whose names are Ometecutli and
Omecioatl,<a id="FNanchor_IX-24" href="#Footnote_IX-24" class="fnanchor">[IX-24]</a> who live on the ninth heaven, which is the
place of the habitation of the gods. We know not what
are the gifts that this infant brings with it; we know
not what was given to it before the beginning of the
world; we know not what it is, nor what mischief and
vice it brings with it taken from its father and mother.
It is now in thine hands, wash and cleanse it as thou knowest
to be necessary; in thine hands we leave it. Purge
it from the filthiness it inherits from its father and its
mother, all spot and defilement let the water carry away
and undo. See good, O our lady, to cleanse and purify
its heart and life that it may lead a quiet and peaceable
life in this world; for indeed we leave this creature in
thine hands, who art mother and lady of the gods, and
alone worthy of the gift of cleansing that thou has held
from before the beginning of the world; see good to do
as we have entreated thee to this child now in thy presence.</p>

<p>Then the midwife spake again; I pray thee to receive
this child here brought before thee. This said, the midwife
took water and blew her breath upon it, and gave
to taste of it to the babe, and touched the babe with it
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371">371</a></span>
on the breast and on the top of the head. Then she
said: My well-beloved son, or daughter, approach here
thy mother and father, Chalchihuitlicue and Chalchihuitlatonac;
let now this goddess take thee, for she has to
bear thee on her shoulders and in her arms through this
world. Then the midwife dipped the child into water
and said: Enter, my son, into the water that is called
<i>mamatlac</i> and <i>tuspalac</i>; let it wash thee; let him cleanse
thee that is in every place, let him see good to put away
from thee all the evil that thou hast carried with thee
from before the beginning of the world, the evil that
thy father and thy mother have joined to thee. Having
so washed the creature, the midwife then wrapped
it up, addressing it the while as follows: O precious
stone, O rich feather, O emerald, O sapphire, thou wert
shaped where abide the great god and the great goddess
that are above the heavens; created and formed thou
wert by thy mother and father, Ometecutli and Omecioatl,
the celestial woman and the celestial man. Thou
hast come into this world, a place of many toils and
troubles, of intemperate heat and intemperate cold and
wind, a place of hunger and thirst, of weariness and of
tears; of a verity we cannot say that this world is other
than a place of weeping, of sadness, of vexation. Behold
thy lot, weariness and weeping and tears. Thou
hast come, my well-beloved, repose then and take here
thy rest; let our Lord that is in every place provide for
and support thee. And in saying all these things the
midwife spake softly, as one that prays.</p>

<p>The second lustration or baptism, usually took place
on the fifth day after birth, but in every case the astrologers
and diviners were consulted, and if the signs were
not propitious, the baptism was postponed till a day of
good sign came. The ceremony, when the child was a
boy, began by bringing to it a little shield, bow, and
arrows; of which arrows there were four, one pointing
toward each of the four points of the world. There
were also brought a little shield, bow, and arrows, made
of paste or dough of wild amaranth seeds, and a pottage
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372">372</a></span>
of beans and toasted maize, and a little breech-clout and
blanket or mantle. The poor in such cases had no more
than the little shield, bow, and arrows, together with some
tamales and toasted maize. When the child was a girl,
there were brought to it, instead of mimic weapons, certain
woman's implements and tools for spinning and
weaving, the spindle and distaff, a little shirt and petticoats.
These things being prepared, suiting the sex of
the infant, its parents and relatives assembled before
sunrise. When the sun rose the midwife asked for a
new vessel full of water; and she took the child in her
hands. Then the by-standers carried all the implements
and utensils already mentioned into the court-yard of
the house, where the midwife set the face of the child
toward the west, and spake to the child saying: O
grandson of mine, O eagle, O tiger, O valiant man,
thou hast come into the world, sent by thy father and
mother, the great Lord and the great lady; thou wast
created and begotten in thy house, which is the place of
the supreme gods that are above the nine heavens. Thou
art a gift from our son Quetzalcoatl, who is in every
place; join thyself now to thy mother, the goddess of
water, Chalchihuitlicue.</p>

<p>Then the midwife gave the child to taste of the water,
putting her moistened fingers in its mouth, and said:
Take this; by this thou hast to live on the earth, to
grow and to flourish; through this we get all things that
support existence on the earth; receive it. Then with
her moistened fingers she touched the breast of the child,
and said: Behold the pure water that washes and
cleanses thine heart, that removes all filthiness; receive
it; may the goddess see good to purify and cleanse thine
heart. Then the midwife poured water upon the head
of the child saying: O my grandson, my son, take this
water of the Lord of the world, which is thy life, invigorating
and refreshing, washing and cleansing. I
pray that this celestial water, blue and light blue, may
enter into thy body and there live; I pray that it may
destroy in thee and put away from thee all the things
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373">373</a></span>
evil and adverse that were given thee before the beginning
of the world. Into thine hand, O goddess of water,
are all mankind put, because thou art our mother Chalchihuitlicue.
Having so washed the body of the child
and so spoken, the midwife said: Wheresoever thou art
in this child, O thou hurtful thing, begone, leave it, put
thyself apart; for now does it live anew, and anew is it
born; now again is it purified and cleansed; now again
is it shaped and engendered by our mother the goddess
of water.</p>

<p class="sidenote">PRAYER TO THE EARTH-MOTHER.</p>

<p>All these things being done and spoken, the midwife
lifted the child in both her hands toward heaven and
said: O Lord, behold here thy creature that thou hast
sent to this place of pain, of affliction, of anguish, to this
world. Give it, O Lord, thy gifts and thine inspiration,
forasmuch as thou art the great god, and hast with
thee the great goddess. Then the midwife stooped again
and set the child upon the earth, and raised it the second
time toward heaven, saying: O our lady, who art
mother of the heavens, who art called Citlalatonac,<a id="FNanchor_IX-25" href="#Footnote_IX-25" class="fnanchor">[IX-25]</a> to
thee I direct my voice and my cry; I pray thee to inspire
with thy virtue, what virtue soever it may be, to
give and to instil it into this creature. Then the midwife
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374">374</a></span>
stooped again and set the child on the ground, and
raised it the third time toward heaven, and said: O our
Lord, god and goddess celestial, that are in the heavens,
behold this creature; see good to pour into it thy virtue
and thy breath, so that it may live upon the earth.
Then a fourth and last time the midwife set the babe
upon the ground, a fourth time she lifted it toward
heaven, and she spake to the sun and said: O our Lord,
Sun, Totonametl, Tlaltecutli, that art our mother and our
father, behold this creature, which is like a bird of precious

Lord the Sun, he is; thou who art valiant in war and
painted like a tiger in black and gray, he is thy creature
and of thine estate and patrimony. For this he was
born, to serve thee and to give thee food and drink; he
is of the family of warriors and soldiers that fight on
the field of battle.</p>

<p class="sidenote">DEDICATION OF THE CHILD TO WAR.</p>

<p>Then the midwife took the shield, and the bow and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375">375</a></span>
the dart that were there prepared, and spake to the Sun
after this sort: Behold here the instruments of war
which thou art served with, which thou delightest in;
impart to this babe the gift that thou art wont to give
to thy soldiers, enabling them to go to thine house of
delights, where, having fallen in battle, they rest and are
joyful and are now with thee praising thee. Will this
poor little nobody ever be one of them? Have pity upon
him, O clement Lord of ours.</p>

<p>During all the time of these ceremonies a great torch
of candlewood was burning; and when these ceremonies
were accomplished, a name was given to the child, that
of one of his ancestors, so that he might inherit the fortune
or lot of him whose name was so taken. This name
was applied to the child by the midwife, or priestess,
who performed the baptism. Suppose the name given
was Yautl. Then the midwife began to shout and to
talk like a man to the child: O Yautl, O valiant man,
take this shield and this dart; these are for thy amusement,
they are the delight of the sun. Then she tied
the little mantle on its shoulders and girt the breech-clout
about it. Now all the boys of the ward were assembled,
and at this stage of the ceremony they rushed
into the house where the baptism had taken place, and
representing soldiers and forrayers, they took food that
was there prepared for them, which was called 'the
navel-string,' or 'navel,' of the child, and set out with
it into the streets, shouting and eating. They cried O
Yautl, Yautl, get thee to the field of battle, put thyself
into the thickest of the fight; O Yautl, Yautl, thine office
is to make glad the sun and the earth, to give them to
eat and to drink; upon thee has fallen the lot of the
soldiers that are eagles and tigers, that die in war, that
are now making merry and singing before the sun.
And they cried again: O soldiers, O men of war, come
hither, come to eat of the navel of Yautl. Then the
midwife, or priestess, took the child into the house, and
departed, the great torch of candlewood being carried
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376">376</a></span>
burning before her, and this was the last of the ceremony.<a id="FNanchor_IX-27" href="#Footnote_IX-27" class="fnanchor">[IX-27]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE AZTEC VENUS.</p>

<p>The goddess (or god, as some have it) connected by
the Mexicans with carnal love was variously called Tlazolteotl,
Ixcuina, Tlaclquani, with other names, and,
especially it would appear in Tlascala, Xochiquetzal.
She had no very prominent or honorable place in the
minds of the people and was much more closely allied to
the Roman Cloacina than to the Greek Aphrodite.
Camargo, the Tlascaltec, gives much the most agreeable
and pleasing account of her. Her home was in the
ninth heaven, in a pleasant garden, watered by innumerable
fountains, where she passed her time spinning
and weaving rich stuffs, in the midst of delights, ministered
to by the inferior deities. No man was able to
approach her, but she had in her service a crowd of
dwarfs, buffoons, and hunchbacks, who diverted her with
their songs and dances, and acted as messengers to such
gods as she took a fancy to. So beautiful was she painted
that no woman in the world could equal her; and the
place of her habitation was called Iamotamohuanichan,
Xochitlycacan, Chitamihuany, Cicuhnauhuepaniuhcan,
and Tuhecayan, that is to say 'the place of Tamohuan,
the place of the tree of flowers Xochitlihcacan, where the
air is purest, beyond the nine heavens.' It was further
said, that whoever had been touched by one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378">378</a></span>
flowers that grow in the beautiful garden of Xochiquetzal
should love to the end, should love faithfully.<a id="FNanchor_IX-28" href="#Footnote_IX-28" class="fnanchor">[IX-28]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">TLAZOLTEOTL SEDUCES YÁPPAN.</p>

<p>Boturini gives a legend in which this goddess figures
in a very characteristic way. There was a man called
Yáppan, who, to win the regard of the gods made himself
a hermit, leaving his wife and his relations, and retiring
to a desert place, there to lead a chaste and solitary
life. In that desert was a great stone or rock,
called Tehuehuetl, dedicated to penitential acts, which
rock Yáppan ascended and took up his abode upon like
a western Simeon Stylites. The gods observed all this
with attention, but doubtful of the firmness of purpose
of the new recluse, they set a spy upon him in the person
of an enemy of his, named Yáotl, the word <i>yáotl</i> indeed
signifying 'enemy.' Yet not even the sharpened
eye of hate and envy could find any spot in the austere
continent life of the anchorite, and the many women sent
by the gods to tempt him to pleasure were repulsed and
baffled. In heaven itself the chaste victories of the
lonely saint were applauded, and it began to be thought
that he was worthy to be transformed into some higher
form of life. Then Tlazolteotl, feeling herself slighted
and held for naught, rose up in her evil beauty, wrathful,
contemptuous, and said: Think not, ye high and immortal
gods, that this hero of yours has the force to preserve
his resolution before me, or that he is worthy of
any very sublime transformation; I descend to earth,
behold now how strong is the vow of your devotee, how
unfeigned his continence!</p>

<p>That day the flowers of the gardens of Xochiquetzal
were untended by their mistress, her singing dwarfs
were silent, her messengers undisturbed by her behests,
and away in the desert, by the lonely rock, the
crouching spy Yáotl saw a wondrous sight: one shaped
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379">379</a></span>
like a woman, but fairer than eye can conceive, advancing
toward the lean penance-withered man on
the sacred height. Ha! thrills not the hermit's mortified
flesh with something more than surprise, while
the sweet voice speaks: My brother Yáppan, I the goddess
Tlazolteotl, amazed at thy constancy, and commiserating
thy hardships, come to comfort thee; what way shall
I take, or what path, that I may get up to speak with
thee? The simple one did not see the ruse, he came
down from his place and helped the goddess up. Alas,
in such a crisis, what need is there to speak further?&mdash;no
other victory of Yáppan was destined to be famous in
heaven, but in a cloud of shame his chaste light went
down for ever. And thou, O shameless one, have thy
fierce red lips had their fill of kisses, is thy Paphian
soul satisfied withal, as now, flushed with victory,
thou passest back to the tinkling fountains, and to the
great tree of flowers, and to the far-reaching gardens
where thy slaves await thee in the ninth heaven? Do
thine eyes lower themselves at all in any heed of
the miserable disenchanted victim left crouching,
humbled on his desecrated rock, his nights and days of
fasting and weariness gone for naught, his dreams, his
hopes dissipated, scattered like dust at the trailing of thy
robes? And for thee, poor Yáppan, the troubles of this
life are soon to end; Yáotl, the enemy, has not seen all
these things for nothing; he, at least, has not borne
hunger and thirst and weariness, has not watched and
waited in vain. O it avails nothing to lift the pleading
hands, they are warm but not with clasping in prayer,
and weary but not with waving the censer; the flint-edged
mace beats down thy feeble guard, the neck that
Tlazolteotl clasped is smitten through, the lips she kissed
roll in the dust beside a headless trunk.</p>

<p>The gods transformed the dead man into a scorpion,
with the forearms fixed lifted up as when he deprecated
the blow of his murderer; and he crawled under the
stone upon which he had abode. His wife, whose name
was Tlahuitzin, that is to say 'the inflamed,' still lived.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380">380</a></span>
The implacable Yáotl sought her out, led her to the spot
stained with her husband's blood, detailed pitilessly the
circumstances of the sin and death of the hermit, and
then smote off her head. The gods transformed the poor
woman into that species of scorpion called the <i>alacran
encendido</i>, and she crawled under the stone and found
her husband. And so it comes that tradition says that
all reddish colored scorpions are descended from Tlahuitzin,
and all dusky or ash-colored scorpions from Yáppan,
while both keep hidden under the stones and flee
the light for shame of their disgrace and punishment.
Last of all the wrath of the gods fell on Yáotl for his
cruelty and presumption in exceeding their commands;
he was transformed into a sort of locust that the Mexicans
call <i>ahuacachapullin</i>.<a id="FNanchor_IX-29" href="#Footnote_IX-29" class="fnanchor">[IX-29]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">CONFESSION.</p>

<p>Sahagun gives a very full description of this goddess
and her connection with certain rites of confession, much
resembling those already described in speaking of Tezcatlipoca.<a id="FNanchor_IX-30" href="#Footnote_IX-30" class="fnanchor">[IX-30]</a>
The goddess had according to our author,
three names. The first was Tlazolteotl, that is to say
'the goddess of carnality.' The second name was
Yxcuina, which signifies four sisters, called respectively,
and in order of age, Tiacapan, Teicu, Tlaco,
Xucotsi. The third and last name of this deity was
Tlaclquani, which means 'eater of filthy things,' referring
it is said to her function of hearing and pardoning
the confessions of men and women guilty of unclean
and carnal crimes. For this goddess, or these goddesses,
had power not only to inspire and provoke to
the commission of such sins, and to aid in their accomplishment,
but also to pardon them, if they were confessed
to certain priests who were also diviners and tellers
of fortunes and wizards generally. In this confession,
however, Tlazolteotl seems not to have been directly addressed,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381">381</a></span>
but only the supreme deity under several of his
names. Thus the person whom, by a stretch of courtesy,
we may call the penitent, having sought out a confessor
from the class above mentioned, addressed that functionary
in these words: Sir, I wish to approach the all-powerful
god, protector of all, Yoalliehecatl, or Tezcatlipoca;
I wish to confess my sins in secret. To this the
wizard, or priest, replied: Welcome, my son; the thing
thou wouldst do is for thy good and profit. This said,
he searched the divining book, <i>tonalamatl</i>, to see what
day would be most opportune for hearing the confession.
That day come, the penitent brought a new mat, and
white incense called <i>copalli</i>, and wood for the fire in
which the incense was to be burned. Sometimes when
he was a very noble personage, the priest went to his
house to confess him, but as a general rule the ceremony
took place at the residence of the priest. On entering
this house the penitent swept very clean a portion of the
floor and spread the new mat there for the confessor to
seat himself upon, and kindled the wood. The priest
then threw the copal upon the fire and said: O Lord,
thou that art the father and the mother of the gods and
the most ancient god,<a id="FNanchor_IX-31" href="#Footnote_IX-31" class="fnanchor">[IX-31]</a> know that here is come thy
vassal and servant, weeping and with great sadness; he
is aware that he has wandered from the way, that he
has stumbled, that he has slidden, that he is spotted
with certain filthy sins and grave crimes worthy of death.
Our Lord, very pitiful, since thou art the protector and
defender of all, accept the penitence, give ear to the anguish
of this thy servant and vassal.</p>

<p>At this point the confessor turned to the sinner and
said: My son, thou art come into the presence of God,
favorer and protector of all; thou art come to lay bare
thy inner rottenness and unsavoriness; thou art come to
publish the secrets of thine heart; see that thou fall into
no pit by lying unto our Lord; strip thyself, put away
all shame before him who is called Yoalliehecatl and
Tezcatlipoca. It is certain that thou art now in his presence,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382">382</a></span>
although thou art not worthy to see him, neither
will he speak with thee, for he is invisible and impalpable.
See then to it how thou comest, and with what heart;
fear nothing to publish thy secrets in his presence, give
account of thy life, relate thine evil deeds as thou didst
perform them; tell all with sadness to our Lord God,
who is the favorer of all, and whose arms are open and
ready to embrace and set thee on his shoulders. Beware
of hiding anything through shame or through weakness.</p>

<p>Having heard these words the penitent took oath,
after the Mexican fashion, to tell the truth. He touched
the ground with his hand and licked off the earth that
adhered to it;<a id="FNanchor_IX-32" href="#Footnote_IX-32" class="fnanchor">[IX-32]</a> then he threw copal in the fire, which
was another way of swearing to tell the truth. Then
he set himself down before the priest and, inasmuch as
he held him to be the image and vicar of god, he, the
penitent, began to speak after this fashion: O our Lord
who receivest and shelterest all, give ear to my foul
deeds; in thy presence I strip, I put away from myself
what shameful things soever I have done. Not from thee,
of a verity, are hidden my crimes, for to thee all things
are manifest and clear. Having thus said, the penitent
proceeded to relate his sins in the order in which they
had been committed, clearly and quietly, as in a slow and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383">383</a></span>
distinctly pronounced chant, as one that walked along a
very straight way turning neither to the right hand nor
to the left. When he had done the priest answered him
as follows: My son, thou hast spoken before our Lord
God, revealing to him thine evil works; and I shall now
tell thee what thou hast to do. When the goddesses Civapipilti
descend to the earth, or when it is the time of
the festival of the four sister goddesses of carnality that
are called Yxcuina, thou shalt fast four days afflicting
thy stomach and thy mouth; this feast of the Yxcuina
being come, at daybreak thou shalt do penance suitable
to thy sins.<a id="FNanchor_IX-33" href="#Footnote_IX-33" class="fnanchor">[IX-33]</a> Through a hole pierced by a maguey-thorn
through the middle of thy tongue thou shall pass certain
osier-twigs called <i>teucalzacatl</i> or <i>tlacotl</i>, passing them in
front of the face and throwing them over the shoulder
one by one; or thou mayest fasten them the one to the
other and so pull them through thy tongue like a long
cord. These twigs were sometimes passed through a
hole in the ear; and, wherever they were passed, it
would appear by our author that there were sometimes
used of them by one penitent to the number of four
hundred, or even of eight hundred.</p>

<p class="sidenote">PENANCES.</p>

<p>If the sin seemed too light for such a punishment as
the preceding, the priest would say to the penitent: My
son, thou shalt fast, thou shall fatigue thy stomach with
hunger and thy mouth with thirst, and that for four
days, eating only once on each day and that at noon.
Or, the priest would say to him: Thou shalt go to offer
paper in the usual places, thou shalt make images covered
therewith in number proportionate to thy devotion, thou
shalt sing and dance before them as custom directs. Or,
again, he would say to him: Thou hast offended God,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384">384</a></span>
thou hast got drunk; thou must expiate the matter before
Totochti, the god of wine; and when thou goest to
do penance thou shalt go at night, naked, save only a
piece of paper hanging from thy girdle in front and another
behind; thou shalt repeat thy prayer and then
throw down there before the gods those two pieces of
paper, and so take thy departure.</p>

<p>This confession was held not to have been made to
a priest, or to a man, but to God; and, inasmuch as it
could only be heard once in a man's life, and, as for a
relapse into sin after it there was no forgiveness, it was
generally put off till old age. The absolution given by
the priest was valuable in a double regard; the absolved
was held shriven of every crime he had confessed, and
clear of all pains and penalties, temporal or spiritual,
civil or ecclesiastical, due therefor. Thus was the fiery
lash of Nemesis bound up, thus were struck down alike
the staff of Minos and the sword of Themis before the
awful ægis of religion. It may be imagined with what
reluctance this last hope, this unique life-confession was
resorted to; it was the one city of refuge, the one Mexican
benefit of sanctuary, the sole horn of the altar, of
which a man might once take hold and live, but no
more again for ever.<a id="FNanchor_IX-34" href="#Footnote_IX-34" class="fnanchor">[IX-34]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385">385</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">GOD OF FIRE.</p>

<p>The Mexican god of fire as we have already noticed
was usually called Xiuhtecutli. He had, however, other
names such as Ixcozauhqui, that is to say, 'yellow-faced;'
and Cuecaltzin, which means 'flame of fire;' and Huehueteotl,
or 'the ancient god.'<a id="FNanchor_IX-35" href="#Footnote_IX-35" class="fnanchor">[IX-35]</a> His idol represented
a naked man, the chin blackened with ulli, and wearing
a lip-jewel of red stone. On his head was a parti-colored
paper crown, with green plumes issuing from the
top of it like flames of fire; from the sides hung tassels
of feathers down to the ears. The ear-rings of the image
were of turquoise wrought in mosaic. On the idol's
back was a dragon's head made of yellow feathers and
some little marine shells. To the ankles were attached
little bells or rattles. On the left arm was a shield,
almost entirely covered with a plate of gold, into which
were set in the shape of a cross five chalchiuites. In
the right hand the god held a round pierced plate of
gold, called the 'looking-plate,' (<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">mirador ó miradero</span>); with
this he covered his face, looking only through the hole
in the golden plate. Xiuhtecutli was held by the people to
be their father, and regarded with feelings of mingled love
and fear; and they celebrated to him two fixed festivals
every year, one in the tenth and another in the eighteenth
month, together with a movable feast in which, according
to Clavigero, they appointed magistrates and renewed
the ceremony of the investiture of the fiefs of the
kingdom. The sacrifices of the first of these festivals,
the festival of the tenth month, Xocotlveti, were particularly
cruel even for the Mexican religion.</p>

<p class="sidenote">FESTIVAL OF THE FIRE GOD.</p>

<p>The assistants began by cutting down a great tree of
five and twenty fathoms long and dressing off the
branches, removing all it would seem but a few round
the top. This tree was then dragged by ropes into the
city, on rollers apparently, with great precaution against
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386">386</a></span>
bruising or spoiling it; and the women met the entering
procession giving those that dragged cacao to drink.
The tree, which was called <i>xocotl</i>, was received into the
court of a cu with shouts; and there set up in a hole in
the ground and allowed to remain for twenty days.
On the eve of the festival Xocotlvetzi, they let this large
tree or pole down gently to the ground, by means of
ropes and trestles, or rests, made of beams tied two and
two, probably in an X shape; and carpenters dressed it
perfectly smooth and straight, and, where the branches
had been left, near the top, they fastened with ropes a
kind of yard or cross-beam of five fathoms long. Then
was prepared, to be set on the very top of the pole or
tree, a statue of the god Xiuhtecutli, made like a man
out of the dough of wild amaranth seeds, and covered
and decorated with innumerable white papers. Into
the head of the image were stuck strips of paper instead
of hair; sashes of paper crossed the body from each
shoulder; on the arms were pieces of paper like wings,
painted over with figures of sparrow-hawks; a maxtli
of paper covered the loins; and a kind of paper
shirt or tabard covered all. Great strips of paper, half a
fathom broad and ten fathoms long, floated from the
feet of the dough god half way down the tree; and into
his head were struck three rods with a tamale or small
pie on the top of each. The tree being now prepared
with all these things, ten ropes were attached to the
middle of it, and by the help of the above-mentioned
trestles and a large crowd pulling all together, the whole
structure was reared into an upright position and there
fixed, with great shouting and stamping of feet.</p>

<p>Then came all those that had captives to sacrifice;
they came decorated for dancing, all the body painted
yellow (which is the livery color of the god), and the
face vermilion. They wore a mass of the red plumage
of the parrot, arranged to resemble a butterfly, and
carried shields covered with white feathers and as it
were the feet of tigers or eagles walking. Each one
went dancing side by side with his captive. These
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387">387</a></span>
captives had the body painted white, and the face vermilion,
save the cheeks which were black; they were
adorned with papers, much, apparently, as the dough
image was, and they had white feathers on the head and
lip-ornaments of feathers. At set of sun the dancing
ceased; the captives were shut up in the <i>calpulli</i>, and
watched by their owners, not being even allowed to sleep.
About midnight every owner shaved away the hair of
the top of the head of his slave, which hair, being
fastened with red thread to a little tuft of feathers, he
put in a small case of cane, and attached to the rafters
of his house, that every one might see that he was a
valiant man and had taken a captive. The knife with
which this shaving was accomplished was called the claw
of the sparrow-hawk. At daybreak the doomed and
shorn slaves were arranged in order in front of the place
called Tzompantli, where the skulls of the sacrificed were
spitted in rows. Here one of the priests went along the
row of captives taking from them certain little banners
that they carried and all their raiment or adornment,
and burning the same in a fire; for raiment or ornament
these unfortunates should need no more on earth.
While they were standing thus all naked and waiting
for death, there came another priest, carrying in
his arms the image of the god Paynal and his
ornaments; he ran up with this idol to the top
of the cu Tlacacouhcan where the victims were to
die. Down he came, then up again, and as he went
up the second time the owners took their slaves by
the hair and led them to the place called Apetlac and
there left them. Immediately there descended from the
cu those that were to execute the sacrifice, bearing bags
of a kind of stupefying incense called <i>yiauhtli</i>,<a id="FNanchor_IX-36" href="#Footnote_IX-36" class="fnanchor">[IX-36]</a> which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388">388</a></span>
they threw by handfuls into the faces of the victims
to deaden somewhat their agonies in the fearful death
before them. Each captive was then bound hand and
foot and so carried up to the top of the cu where smouldered
a huge heap of live coal. The carriers heaved their
living burdens in; and the old narrative gives minute
details about the great hole made in the sparkling embers
by each slave, and how the ashy dust rose in a cloud as
he fell. As the dust settled the bound bodies could be
seen writhing and jerking themselves about in torment
on their soft dull-red bed, and their flesh could be heard
crackling and roasting. Now came a part of the ceremony
requiring much experience and judgment; the
wild-eyed priests stood grappling-hook in hand biding
their time. The victims were not to die in the fire, the
instant the great blisters began to rise handsomely over
their scorched skins it was enough, they were raked
out. The poor blackened bodies were then flung on the
'tajon' and the agonized soul dismissed by the sacrificial
breast-cut (from nipple to nipple, or a little lower); the
heart was then torn out and cast at the feet of Xiuhtecutli,
god of fire.</p>

<p class="sidenote">CLIMBING FOR THE GOD.</p>

<p>This slaughter being over, the statue of Paynal was
carried away to its own cu and every man went home to
eat. And the young men and boys, all those called
<i>quexpaleque</i>,<a id="FNanchor_IX-37" href="#Footnote_IX-37" class="fnanchor">[IX-37]</a> because they had a lock of hair at the nape
of the neck, came, together with all the people, the
women in order among the men, and began at mid-day
to dance and to sing in the court-yard of Xiuhtecutli;
the place was so crowded that there was hardly room to
move. Suddenly there arose a great cry, and a rush
was made out of the court toward the place where was
raised the tall tree already described at some length.
Let us shoulder our way forward, not without risk to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389">389</a></span>
our ribs, and see what we can see: there stands the tall
pole with streamers of paper and the ten ropes by which
it was raised dangling from it. On the top stands the
dough image of the fire god, with all his ornaments and
weapons, and with the three tamales sticking out so
oddly above his head. Ware clubs! we press too close;
shoulder to shoulder in a thick serried ring round the
foot of the pole stand the 'captains of the youths' keeping
the youngsters back with cudgels, till the word be
given at which all may begin to climb the said pole for
the great prize at the top. But the youths are wild for
fame; old renowned heroes look on; the eyes of all the
women of the city are fixed on the great tree where it
shoots above the head of the struggling crowd; glory to
him who first gains the cross-beam and the image.
Stand back, then, ye captains, let us pass! There is a
rush, and a trampling, and despite a rain of blows, all
the pole with its hanging ropes is aswarm with climbers,
thrusting each other down. The first youth at the top
seizes the idol of dough; he takes the shield and the
arrows and the darts and the stick <i>atalt</i> for throwing
the darts; he takes the tamales from the head of the
statue, crumbles them up, and throws the crumbs with
the plumes of the image down into the crowd; the securing
of which crumbs and plumes is a new occasion for
shouting and scrambling and fisticuffs among the multitude.
When the young hero comes down with the
weapons of the god which he has secured, he is received
with far-roaring applause and carried up to the cu Tlacacouhcan,
there to receive the reward of his activity and
endurance, praises and jewels and a rich mantle not lawful
for another to wear, and the honor of being carried
by the priests to his house, amid the music of horns and
shells. The festivity is over now; all the people lay hold
on the ropes fastened to the tree, and pull it down
with a crash that breaks it to pieces, together, apparently,
with all that is left of the wild-amaranth-dough image
of Xiuhtecutli.<a id="FNanchor_IX-38" href="#Footnote_IX-38" class="fnanchor">[IX-38]</a></p>

<p>Another feast of the god of fire was held in the month
Yzcalli, the eighteenth month; it was called <i>motlaxquiantota</i>,
that is to say 'our father the fire toasts his food.'
An image of the god of fire was made, with a frame of
hoops and sticks tied together as the basis or model to be
covered with his ornaments. On the head of this image
was put a shining mask of turquoise mosaic, banded
across with rows of green chalchiuites. Upon the mask
was put a crown fitting to the head below, wide above,
and gorgeous with rich plumage as a flower; a wig of
reddish hair was attached to this crown so that the
evenly cut locks flowed from below it, behind and around
the mask, as if they were natural. A robe of costly
feathers covered all the front of the image and fell over the
ground before the feet, so light that it shivered and floated
with the least breath of air till the variegated feathers
glittered and changed color like water. The back of the
image seems to have been left unadorned, concealed by
a throne on which it was seated, a throne covered with
a dried tiger-skin, paws and head complete. Before this
statue new fire was produced at midnight by boring
rapidly by hand one stick upon another; the spunk or
tinder so inflamed was put on the hearth and a fire lit.<a id="FNanchor_IX-39" href="#Footnote_IX-39" class="fnanchor">[IX-39]</a>
At break of day came all the boys and youths with game
and fish that they had captured on the previous day;
walking round the fire, they gave it to certain old men
that stood there, who taking it threw it into the flames
before the god, giving the youths in return certain tamales
that had been made and offered for this purpose by
the women. To eat these tamales it was necessary to
strip off the maize-leaves in which they had been wrapped
and cooked; these leaves were not thrown into the fire,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391">391</a></span>
but were all put together and thrown into water. After
this all the old men of the ward in which the fire was,
drank pulque and sang before the image of Xiuhtecutli
till night. This was the tenth day of the month and
thus finished that feast, or that part of the feast, which
was called <i>vauquitamalqualiztli</i>.</p>

<p>On the twentieth and last day of the month was made
another statue of the fire god, with a frame of sticks and
hoops as already described. They put on the head of it
a mask with a ground of mosaic of little bits of the shell
called <i>tapaztli</i>,<a id="FNanchor_IX-40" href="#Footnote_IX-40" class="fnanchor">[IX-40]</a> composed below the mouth of black stones,
banded across the nostrils with black stones of another
sort, and the cheeks made of a still different stone called
<i>tezcapuchtli</i>. As in the previous case there was a crown
on this mask, and over all and over the body of the
image costly and beautiful decorations of feather-work.
Before the throne on which this statue sat there was a
fire, and the youths offered game to and received cakes
from the old men with various ceremonies; the day
being closed with a great drinking of pulque by the old
people, though not to the point of intoxication. Thus
ended the eighteenth month; and with regard to the two
ceremonies just described, Sahagun says, that though
not observed in all parts of Mexico, they were observed
at least in Tezcuco.</p>

<p class="sidenote">FOURTH YEAR FESTIVAL.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that the festivals of this month have
been without human sacrifices; but every fourth year was
an exception to this. In such a year on the twentieth
and last day of this eighteenth month, being also, according
to some, the last day of the year, the five Nemonteni, or
unlucky days, being excepted, men and women were slain
as images of the god of fire. The women that had to
die carried all their apparel and ornaments on their
shoulders, and the men did the same. Arrived thus
naked where they had to die, men and women alike
were decorated to resemble the god of fire; they ascended
the cu, walked round the sacrificial stone, and then descended
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392">392</a></span>
and returned to the place where they were to
be kept for the night. Each male victim had a rope tied
round the middle of his body which was held by his
guards. At midnight the hair of the crown of the head
of each was shaven off before the fire and kept for a
relic, and the head itself was covered with a mixture
of resin and hens' feathers. After this the doomed
ones burned or gave away to their keepers their now
useless apparel, and as the morning broke they were
decorated with papers and led in procession to die, with
singing and shouting and dancing. These festivities
went on till mid-day, when a priest of the cu, arrayed in
the ornaments of the god Paynal, came down, passed
before the victims, and then went up again. They were
led up after him, captives first and slaves after, in the
order they had to die in; they suffered in the usual
manner. There was then a grand dance of the lords,
led by the king himself; each dancer wearing a high-fronted
paper coronet, a kind of false nose of blue paper,
ear-rings of turquoise mosaic, or of wood wrought with
flowers, a blue curiously flowered jacket, and a mantle.
Hanging to the neck of each was the figure of a dog
made of paper and painted with flowers; in the right
hand was carried a stick shaped like a chopping-knife,
the lower half of which was painted red and the upper
half white; in the left hand was carried a little paper
bag of copal. This dance was begun on the top of the
cu and finished by descending and going four times
round the court-yard of the cu; after which all entered
the palace with the king. This dance took place only
once in four years, and none but the king and his lords
could take part in it. On this day the ears of all children
born during the three preceding years were bored
with a bone awl, and the children themselves passed
near or through the flames of a fire as already related.<a id="FNanchor_IX-41" href="#Footnote_IX-41" class="fnanchor">[IX-41]</a>
There was a further ceremony of taking the children by
the head and lifting them up "to make them grow;"
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_393">393</a></span>
and from this the month took its name, Yzcalli meaning
'growth.'<a id="FNanchor_IX-42" href="#Footnote_IX-42" class="fnanchor">[IX-42]</a></p>

<p>There was generally observed in honor of fire a custom
called 'the throwing,' which was that no one ate without
first flinging into the fire a scrap of the food. Another
common ceremony was in drinking pulque to first
spill a little on the edge of the hearth. Also when a
person began upon a jar of pulque he emptied out a
little into a broad pan and put it beside the fire, whence
with another vessel he spilt of it four times upon the
edge of the hearth; this was 'the libation or the tasting.'<a id="FNanchor_IX-43" href="#Footnote_IX-43" class="fnanchor">[IX-43]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE GREAT NEW FIRE FESTIVAL.</p>

<p>The most solemn and important of all the Mexican
festivals was that called Toxilmolpilia or Xiuhmolpilli,
the 'the binding up of the years.' Every fifty-two
years was called a sheaf of years; and it
was held for certain that at the end of some sheaf
of fifty-two years the motion of the heavenly bodies
should cease and the world itself come to an end.
As the possible day of destruction drew near all the
people cast their household gods of wood and stone into
the water, as also the stones used on the hearth for cooking and
bruising pepper. They washed thoroughly their
houses, and last of all put out all fires. For the lighting
of the new fire there was a place set apart, the summit
of a mountain called Vixachtlan, or Huixachtla, on the
boundary line between the cities of Itztapalapa and Colhuacan,
about six miles from the city of Mexico. In
the production of this new fire none but priests had any
part, and the task fell specially upon those of the ward
Copolco. On the last day of the fifty-two years, after
the sun had set, all the priests clothed themselves
with the dress and insignia of their gods, so as to
themselves appear like very gods, and set out in procession
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394">394</a></span>
for the mountain, walking very slowly, with
much gravity and silence, as befitted the occasion and
the garb they wore, "walking," as they phrased it, "like
gods." The priest of the ward of Copolco, whose office
it was to produce the fire, carried the instruments thereof
in his hand, trying them from time to time to see that
all was right. Then, a little before midnight, the mountain
being gained, and a cu which was there builded for
that ceremony, they began to watch the heavens and
especially the motion of the Pleiades. Now this night
always fell so that at midnight these seven stars were in
the middle of the sky with respect to the Mexican horizon;
and the priests watched them to see them pass the
zenith and so give sign of the endurance of the world,
for another fifty and two years. That sign was the
signal for the production of the new fire, lit as follows.
The bravest and finest of the prisoners taken in war was
thrown down alive, and a board of very dry wood was
put upon his breast; upon this the acting priest at the
critical moment bored with another stick, twirling it
rapidly between his palms till fire caught. Then instantly
the bowels of the captive were laid open, his
heart torn out, and it with all the body thrown upon and
consumed by a pile of fire. All this time an awful
anxiety and suspense held possession of the people at
large; for it was said, that if anything happened to prevent
the production at the proper time of the new fire,
there would be an end of the human race, the night and
the darkness would be perpetual, and those terrible and
ugly beings the Tzitzimitles<a id="FNanchor_IX-44" href="#Footnote_IX-44" class="fnanchor">[IX-44]</a> would descend to devour
all mankind. As the fateful hour approached, the people
gathered on the flat house-tops, no one willingly remaining
below. All pregnant women, however, were closed
into the granaries, their faces being covered with maize-leaves;
for it was said that if the new fire could not be
produced, these women would turn into fierce animals
and devour men and women. Children also had masks
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_395">395</a></span>
of maize-leaf put on their faces, and they were kept
awake by cries and pushes, it being believed that if they
were allowed to sleep they would become mice.</p>

<p class="sidenote">FEAST OF THE NEW FIRE.</p>

<p>From the crowded house-tops every eye was bent on
Vixachtlan. Suddenly a moving speck of light was
seen by those nearest, and then a great column of flame
shot up against the sky. The new fire! and a great
shout of joy went up from all the country round about.
The stars moved on in their courses; fifty and two years
more at least had the universe to exist. Every one did
penance; cutting his ear with a splinter of flint and
scattering the blood toward the part where the fire was;
even the ears of children in the cradle were so cut.
And now from the blazing pile on the mountain, burning
brands of pine candle-wood were carried by the
swiftest runners toward every quarter of the kingdom.
In the city of Mexico, on the temple of Huitzilopochtli,
before the altar, there was a fire-place of stone and lime
containing much copal; into this a blazing brand was
flung by the first runner, and from this place fire was
carried to all the houses of the priests, and thence again
to all the city. There soon blazed great central fires in
every ward, and it was a thing to be seen the multitude
of people that came together to get light, and the general
rejoicings.</p>

<p>The hearth-fires being thus lit, the inhabitants of every
house began to renew their household gods and furniture,
and to lay down new mats, and to put on new
raiment; they made everything new in sign of the new
sheaf of years; they beheaded quails, and burned incense
in their court-yard toward the four quarters of the
world, and on their hearths. After eating a meal of
wild amaranth seed and honey, a fast was ordered, even
the drinking of water till noon being forbidden. Then
the eating and drinking were renewed, sacrifices of slaves
and captives were made, and the great fires renewed.
The last solemn festival of the new fire was celebrated
in the year 1507, the Spaniards being not then in the
land; and through their presence, there was no public
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_396">396</a></span>
ceremony when the next sheaf of years was finished in
1559.<a id="FNanchor_IX-45" href="#Footnote_IX-45" class="fnanchor">[IX-45]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">TEOYAOMIQUE.</p>

<p class="p2">Mictlan, the Mexican hades, or place of the dead,
signifies either primarily, or by an acquired meaning,
'northward, or toward the north,' though many authorities
have located it underground or below the earth.
This region was the seat of the power of a god best
known under his title of Mictlantecutli; his female companion
was called Mictlancihuatl, made identical by some
legends with Tlazolteotl, and by others apparently with the
serpent-woman and mother goddess.<a id="FNanchor_IX-46" href="#Footnote_IX-46" class="fnanchor">[IX-46]</a> There has been discovered
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397">397</a></span>
and there is now to be seen in the city of Mexico
a huge compound statue, representing various deities, the
most prominent being a certain goddess Teoyaomique,
who, it seems to me, is almost identical with or at least
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398">398</a></span>
a connecting link between the mother goddess and the
companion of Mictlantecutli. Mr Gallatin says<a id="FNanchor_IX-47" href="#Footnote_IX-47" class="fnanchor">[IX-47]</a> that
the Mexican gods "were painted in different ways according
to their various attributes and names: and the
priests were also in the habit of connecting with the
statue of a god or goddess, symbols of other deities which
partook of a similar character. Gama has adduced
several instances of both practices, in the part of his dissertation
which relates to the statue of the goddess of
death found buried in the great Square of Mexico of
which he, and lately Mr Nebel, have given copies.<a id="FNanchor_IX-48" href="#Footnote_IX-48" class="fnanchor">[IX-48]</a> Her
name is Teoyaomiqui, which means, to die in sacred war,
or 'in defense of the gods,' and she is the proper companion
of Huitzilopochtli, the god of war. The symbols
of her own attributes are found in the upper part of the
statue: but those from the waist downwards relate to
other deities connected with her or with Huitzilopochtli.
The serpents are the symbols of his mother Cohuatlycue,
and also of Cihuacohuatl, the serpent woman who begat
twins, male and female, from which mankind proceeded:
the same serpents and feathers are the symbol of Quezatlcohuatl,
the precious stones designate Chalchihuitlycue,
the goddess of water; the teeth and claws refer to Tlaloc
and to Tlatocaocelocelotl (the tiger king): and together
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399">399</a></span>
with her own attributes, the whole is a most horrible
figure."</p>

<p class="sidenote">GAMA ON THE COMPOUND IMAGE.</p>

<p>Of this great compound statue of Huitzilopochtli (for
the most part under his name of Teoyaotlatohua), Teoyaomique,
and Mictlantecutli, and of the three deities separately
Leon y Gama treats, in substance as follows,
beginning with Mictlantecutli:<a id="FNanchor_IX-49" href="#Footnote_IX-49" class="fnanchor">[IX-49]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p>The Chevalier Boturini mentions another of his
names, Teoyaotlatohua, and says that as director and
chief of sacred war he was always accompanied by
Teoyaomique, a goddess whose business it was to
collect the souls of those that died in war and of
those that were sacrificed afterward as captives. Let
these statements be put alongside of what Torquemada
says, to wit, that in the great feast of the month Hueimiccailhuitl,<a id="FNanchor_IX-50" href="#Footnote_IX-50" class="fnanchor">[IX-50]</a>
divine names were given to dead kings
and to all famous persons who had died heroically in
war, and in the power of the enemy; idols were made
furthermore of these persons, and they were put with
the deities; for it was said that they had gone to the place
of delights and pleasures there to be with the gods.
From all this it would appear that before this image, in
which were closely united Teoyaotlatohua and Teoyaomique,
there were each year celebrated certain rites in
memory and honor of dead kings and lords and captains
and soldiers fallen in battle. And not only did the
Mexicans venerate in the temple this image of many
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_400">400</a></span>
gods, but the judicial astrologers feigned a constellation
answering thereto and influencing persons born under
it. In depicting this constellation Teoyaotlatohua Huitzilopochtli
was represented with only half his body, as
it were seated on a bench, and with his mouth open as
if speaking. His head was decorated after a peculiar
fashion with feathers, his arms were made like trunks
of trees with branches, while from his girdle there issued
certain herbs that fell downwards over the bench. Opposite
this figure was Teoyaomique, naked save a thin
robe,<a id="FNanchor_IX-51" href="#Footnote_IX-51" class="fnanchor">[IX-51]</a> and standing on a pedestal, apparently holding her
head in her hands, at any rate with her head cut off,
her eyes bandaged, and two snakes issuing from the neck
where the head should have been. Between the god
and the goddess was a flowering tree divided through the
middle, to which was attached a beam with various crosspieces,
and over all was a bird with the head separated
from its body. There was to be seen also the head of a
bird in a cup, and the head of a serpent, together with
a pot turned upside down while the contents&mdash;water as
it would appear by the hieroglyphics attached&mdash;ran out.</p>

<p>In this form were painted these two gods, as one of
the twenty celestial signs, sufficiently noticed by Boturini,
although as he confesses, he had not arranged them
in the proper order. Returning to notice the office attributed
to Teoyaomique, that of collecting the souls of
the dead, we find that Cristóbal del Castillo says that
all born under the sign which, with the god of war, this
goddess ruled, were to become at an early age valorous
soldiers; but that their career was to be short as it was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401">401</a></span>
brilliant, for they were to fall in battle young. These
souls were to rise to heaven, to dwell in the house of the
sun, where were woods and groves. There they were to
exist four years, at the end of which time they were to
be converted into birds of rich and beautiful plumage,
and to go about sucking flowers both in heaven and on
earth.</p>

<p class="sidenote">MICTECACIHUATL.</p>

<p>To the statue mentioned above there was joined with
great propriety the image of another god, feigned to be
the god of hell, or of the place of the dead, which latter
is the literal signification of his name, Mictlantecutli.
This image was engraved in demi-relief on the lower
plane of the stone of the great compound statue; but it
was also venerated separately in its own proper temple,
called Tlalxicco, that is to say, 'in the bowels or navel
of the earth.' Among the various offices attributed to
this deity was that of burying the corpses of the dead,
principally of those that died of natural infirmities; for
the souls of these went to hell to present themselves before
this Mictlantecutli and before his wife Mictecacihuatl,
which name Torquemada interprets as 'she that
throws into hell.' Thither indeed it was said that these
dead went to offer themselves as vassals carrying offerings,
and to have pointed out to them the places that
they were to occupy according to the manner of their
death. This god of hades was further called Tzontemoc,
a term interpreted by Torquemada to mean 'he that
lowers his head;' but it would rather appear that it
should take its signification from the action indicated
by the great statue, where this deity is seen as it were
carrying down tied to himself the heads of corpses to
bury them in the ground, as Boturini says. The places
or habitations supposed to exist in hell, and to which
the souls of the dead had to go, were nine; in the last of
which, called Chicuhnauhmictlan, the said souls were supposed
to be annihilated and totally destroyed. There
was lastly given to this god a place in heaven, he being
joined with one of the planets and accompanied by Teotlamacazqui;
at his feet, there was painted a body that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_402">402</a></span>
was half buried, or covered with earth from the head to
the waist, while the rest stuck out uncovered. It only
remains to be said that such was the veneration and religious
feeling with which were regarded all things relating
to the dead, that not only there were invented for
them tutelary gods, much honored by frequent feasts and
sacrifice; but the Mexicans elevated Death itself, dedicating
to it a day of the calendar (the first day of the
sixth 'trecena'), joining it to the number of the celestial
signs; and erecting to it a sumptuous temple called
Tolnahuac, within the circuit of the great temple of
Mexico, wherein it was particularly adored with holocausts
and victims under the title Ce Miquiztli.<a id="FNanchor_IX-52" href="#Footnote_IX-52" class="fnanchor">[IX-52]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403">403</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">MIXCOATL, GOD OF HUNTING.</p>

<p>Mixcoatl is the god&mdash;or goddess according to some
good authorities&mdash;of hunting. The name means 'cloud-serpent'
and indeed seems common to a whole class of
deities or heroes somewhat resembling the Nibelungs of
northern European mythology.<a id="FNanchor_IX-53" href="#Footnote_IX-53" class="fnanchor">[IX-53]</a> He is further supposed
to be connected with the thunderstorm: "Mixcoatl,
the Cloud-Serpent, or Iztac-Mixcoatl, the White or
Gleaming Cloud-Serpent," writes Brinton,<a id="FNanchor_IX-54" href="#Footnote_IX-54" class="fnanchor">[IX-54]</a> "said to
have been the only divinity of the ancient Chichimecs,
held in high honor by the Nahuas, Nicaraguans, and
Otomís, and identical with Taras, supreme god of the
Tarascos, and Camaxtli, god of the Teo-Chichimecs, is
another personification of the thunderstorm. To this
day this is the familiar name of the tropical tornado in
the Mexican language. He was represented, like Jove,
with a bundle of arrows in his hand, the thunderbolts.
Both the Nahuas and Tarascos related legends in which
he figured as father of the race of man. Like other
lords of the lightning he was worshiped as the dispenser
of riches and the patron of traffic; and in Nicaragua
his image is described as being 'engraved stones' probably
the supposed products of the thunder."</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404">404</a></span></p>

<p>In the fourteenth month, called Quecholli, and beginning,
according to Clavigero, on the fourteenth of November,
there was made with many obscure ceremonies, a feast
to this god. On the sixth day of the month all assembled
at the cu of Huitzilopochtli, where during four days
they made arrows and darts for use in war and for
general practice at a mark, mortifying at the same time
their flesh by drawing blood, and by abstaining from
women and pulque. This done they made, in honor of
the dead, certain little mimic darts of a hand long, of
which four seem to have been tied together with four
splinters of candle-wood pine; these were put on the
graves, and at set of sun, lit and burned, after which the
ashes were interred on the spot. There were taken a
maize-stalk of nine knots with a paper flag on the top
that hung down to the bottom, together with a shield and
dart belonging to the dead man, and his maxtli and
blanket; the last two being attached to the maize-stalk.
The hanging flag was ornamented on either side with
red cotton thread, in the figure of an X; a piece of
twisted white thread also hung down to which was suspended
a dead humming-bird. Handfuls of the white
feathers of the heron were tied two and two and fastened
to the burdened maize-stalk, while all the cotton threads
used were covered with white hen's feathers, stuck on
with resin. Lastly all these were burned on a stone block
called the <i>quaulixicalcalico</i>.</p>

<p>In the court of the cu of Mixcoatl was scattered much
dried grass brought from the mountains, upon which the
old women-priests, or <i>cioatlamacazque</i>, seated themselves,
each with a mat before her. All the women that had
children came, each bringing her child and five sweet
tamales; and the tamales were put on the mats before
the old women, who in return took the children, tossed
them in their arms and then returned them to their
mothers.</p>

<p class="sidenote">DRIVE-HUNT OF MIXCOATL.</p>

<p>About the middle of the month was made a special
feast to this god of the Otomís, to Mixcoatl. In the
morning all prepared for a great drive-hunt, girding
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_405">405</a></span>
their blankets to their loins, and taking bows and arrows.
They wended their way to a mountain-slope, anciently
Zapatepec, or Yxillantonan, above the sierra of
Atlacuizoayan, or as it is now called, according to Bustamante,
Tacubaya. There they drove deer, rabbits, hares,
coyotes, and other game together, little by little, every
one in the meantime killing what he could; few or
no animals escaping. To the most successful hunters
blankets were given, and every one brought to his house
the heads of the animals he had taken, and hanged them
up for tokens of his prowess or activity.</p>

<p>There were human sacrifices in honor of this hunting
god with other deities. The manufacturers of pulque
bought, apparently two slaves who were decorated with
paper and killed in honor of the gods Tlamatzincatl and
Yzquitecatl; there were also sacrificed women supposed
to represent the wives of these two deities. The <i>calpixquis</i>
on their part led other two slaves to the death in
honor of Mixcoatl and of Cohuatlicue his wife. On the
morning of the last day but one of the month, all the
doomed were brought out and led round the cu where
they had to die; after mid-day they were led up the cu,
round the sacrificial block, down again, then back to the
<i>calpulco</i>, to be at once guarded and forced to keep awake
for the night. At midnight their heads were shaven
before the fire, and every one of them burned there
what goods he had, little paper flags, cane tobacco-pipes<a id="FNanchor_IX-55" href="#Footnote_IX-55" class="fnanchor">[IX-55]</a>
and drinking-vessels; the women threw into
the flame their raiment, their ornaments, their
spindles, little baskets, vessels in which the spindles
were twirled, warping-frames, fuller's earth,
pieces of cane for pressing a fabric together, cords
for fastening it up, maguey-thorns, measuring-rods,
and other implements for weaving; and they said that
all these things had to be given to them in the other
world after their death. At daybreak these captives
were carried or assisted up, each having a paper flag
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_406">406</a></span>
borne before him, to the several cues of the gods they
were to die in honor of. Four that had to die, probably
before Mixcoatl, were, each by four bearers, carried up
to a temple, bound hand and foot to represent dead deer;
while others were merely assisted up the steps by a
youth at each arm, so that they should not faint nor fail;
two other youths trailing or letting them down the same
steps after they were dead. The preceding relates
only to the male captives, the women being slain before
the men, in a separate cu called the <i>coatlan</i>; it is said
that as they were forced up the steps of it some screamed
and others wept. In letting the dead bodies of these
women down the steps again, it is also specially written,
that they were not hurled down roughly, but rolled down
little by little. At the place where the skulls of the
dead were exposed, waited two old women called <i>teixamique</i>,
having by them salt water and bread and a mess
or gruel of some kind. The carcasses of the victims
being brought to them, they dipped cane-leaves into the
salt water and sprinkled the faces of them therewith,
and into each mouth they put four morsels of bread
moistened with the gruel or mess above-mentioned.
Then the heads were cut off and spitted on poles; and so
the feast ended.<a id="FNanchor_IX-56" href="#Footnote_IX-56" class="fnanchor">[IX-56]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">MACUILXOCHITL.</p>

<p class="p2">In connection with the religious honors paid to the
dead, it may be here said that the Mexicans had a deity
of whom almost all we know is that he was the god of
those that died in the houses of the lords or in the
palaces of the principal men; he was called Macuilxochitl,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_407">407</a></span>
'the chief that gives flowers, or that takes care of
the giving of flowers.'<a id="FNanchor_IX-57" href="#Footnote_IX-57" class="fnanchor">[IX-57]</a> The festival of this god fell
among the movable feasts and was called Xochilhuitl,
or 'the festival of flowers.' There were in it the usual
preliminary fasting (that is to say, eating but once a day,
at noon, and then only of a restricted diet), blood-letting,
and offering of food in the temple; though there did not
occur therein anything suggestive either of a god of
flowers or of a god of the more noble dead. The image
of this deity was in the likeness of an almost naked man,
either flayed or painted of a vermilion color; the mouth
and chin were of three tints, white, black, and light blue;
the face was of a light reddish tinge. It had a crown of
light green color, with plumes of the same hue, and tassels
that hung down to the shoulders. On the back of
the idol was a device wrought in feathers, representing
a banner planted on a hill; about the loins of it was a
bright reddish blanket, fringed with sea-shells; curiously
wrought sandals adorned its feet; on the left arm of it
was a white shield, in the midst of which were set four
stones, joined two and two; it held a sceptre, shaped like
a heart and tipped with green and yellow feathers.<a id="FNanchor_IX-58" href="#Footnote_IX-58" class="fnanchor">[IX-58]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408">408</a></span></p>

<p>Ome Acatl was the god of banquets and of guests; his
name signified 'two canes.' When a man made a feast
to his friends, he had the image of this deity carried to
his house by certain of its priests; and if the host did
not do this, the deity appeared to him in a dream, rebuking
him in such words as these: Thou bad man, because
thou hast withheld from me my due honor, know
that I will forsake thee and that thou shalt pay dearly
for this insult. When this god was excessively angered,
he was accustomed to mix hairs with the food and drink
of the guests of the object of his wrath, so that the giver
of the feast should be disgraced. As in the case of
Huitzilopochtli, there was a kind of communion sacrament
in connection with the adoration of this god of
feasts: in each ward dough was taken and kneaded by
the principal men into the figure of a bone of about a
cubit long, called the bone of Ome Acatl. A night seems
to have been spent in eating and in drinking pulque; then
at break of day an unfortunate person, set up as the living
image of the god, had his belly pricked with pins, or
some such articles; being hurt thereby, as we are told.
This done the bone was divided and each one ate what
of it fell to his lot; and when those that had insulted
this god ate, they often grew sick, and almost choked,
and went stumbling and falling. Ome Acatl was represented
as a man seated on a bunch of cyperus-sedges.
His face was painted white and black; upon his head
was a paper crown surrounded by a long and broad fillet
of divers colors, knotted up at the back of the head; and
again round and over the fillet, was wound a string of
chalchiuite beads. His blanket was made like a net, and
had a broad border of flowers woven into it. He bore
a shield, from the lower part of which hung a kind of
fringe of broad tassels. In the right hand he held a
sceptre called the <i>tlachielonique</i>, or 'looker,'<a id="FNanchor_IX-59" href="#Footnote_IX-59" class="fnanchor">[IX-59]</a> because it
was furnished with a round plate through which a hole
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_409">409</a></span>
was pierced, and the god kept his face covered with the
plate and looked through the hole.<a id="FNanchor_IX-60" href="#Footnote_IX-60" class="fnanchor">[IX-60]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">IXTLILTON, HEALER OF CHILDREN.</p>

<p class="p2">Yxtliton, or Ixtlilton&mdash;that is to say 'the little negro,'
according to Sahagun, and 'the black-faced,' according
to Clavigero&mdash;was a god who cured children of various
diseases.<a id="FNanchor_IX-61" href="#Footnote_IX-61" class="fnanchor">[IX-61]</a> His 'oratory' was a kind of temporary building
made of painted boards; his image was neither graven
nor painted; it was a living man decorated with certain
vestments. In this temple or oratory were kept many
pans and jars, covered with boards, and containing a
fluid which was called 'black water.' When a child
sickened, it was brought to this temple and one of these
jars was uncovered, upon which the child drank of the
black water and was healed of its disease&mdash;the cure being
probably most prompt and complete when the priests as
well as the god knew something of physic. When one
made a feast to this god&mdash;which seems to have been
when one made new pulque&mdash;the man that was the
image of Ixtlilton came to the house of the feast-giver
with music and dancing, and preceded by the smoke of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_410">410</a></span>
copal incense. The representative of the deity having
arrived, the first thing he did was to eat and drink;
there were more dances and festivities in his honor, in
which he took part, and then he entered the cellar of
the house, where were many jars of pulque that had been
covered for four days with boards or lids of some kind.
He opened one or many of these jars, a ceremony called
'the opening of the first, or of the new wine,' and himself
with those that were with him drank thereof. This
done, he went out into the court-yard of the house,
where there were prepared certain jars of the above-mentioned
black water, which also had been kept covered
four days; these he opened, and if there was found therein
any dirt, or piece of straw, or hair, or ash, it was
taken as a sign that the giver of the feast was a man of
evil life, an adulterer, or a thief, or a quarrelsome person,
and he was affronted with the charge accordingly.
When the representative of the god set out from the
house where all this occurred, he was presented with
certain blankets called <i>yxguen</i>, or <i>ixquen</i>, that is to say,
'covering of the face,' because when any fault had been
found in the black water, the giver of the feast was put
to shame.<a id="FNanchor_IX-62" href="#Footnote_IX-62" class="fnanchor">[IX-62]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">OPUCHTLI, GOD OF FISHING.</p>

<p class="p2">Opuchtli, or Opochtli, 'the left-handed,' was venerated
by fishermen as their protector and the inventor of their
nets, fish-spears, oars, and other gear. In Cuitlahuac, an
island of lake Chalco, there was a god of fishing called
Amimitl, who, according to Clavigero, differed from the
first-mentioned only in name. Sahagun says that Opuchtli
was counted among the number of the Tlaloques,
and that the offerings made to him were composed of
pulque, stalks of green maize, flowers, the smoking-canes,
or pipes called <i>yietl</i>, copal incense, the odorous herb
<i>yiauhtli</i>, and parched maize. These things seem to have
been strewed before him as rushes used to be strewed
before a procession. There were used in these solemnities
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_411">411</a></span>
certain rattles enclosed in hollow walking-sticks.
The image of this god was like a man, almost naked,
with the face of that grey tint seen in quails' feathers;
on the head was a paper crown of divers colors, made
like a rose, as it were, of leaves overlapping each other,
topped by green feathers issuing from a yellow tassel;
other long tassels hung from this crown to the shoulders
of the idol. Crossed over the breast was a green stole
resembling that worn by the Christian priest when saying
mass; on the feet were white sandals; on the left
arm was a red shield, and in the centre of its field a
white flower with four leaves disposed like a cross; and
in the left hand was a sceptre of a peculiar fashion.<a id="FNanchor_IX-63" href="#Footnote_IX-63" class="fnanchor">[IX-63]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Xipe, or Totec, or Xipetotec, or Thipetotec, is, according
to Clavigero, a god whose name has no meaning,<a id="FNanchor_IX-64" href="#Footnote_IX-64" class="fnanchor">[IX-64]</a>
who was the deity of the goldsmiths, and who was much
venerated by the Mexicans, they being persuaded that
those that neglected his worship would be smitten with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_412">412</a></span>
diseases; especially the boils, the itch, and pains of the
head and eyes. They excelled themselves therefore in
cruelty at his festival time, occurring ordinarily in the
second month.</p>

<p>Sahagun describes this god as specially honored by
dwellers on the sea-shore, and as having had his origin
at Zapotlan in Jalisco. He was supposed to afflict
people with sore eyes and with various skin-diseases,
such as small-pox, abscesses, and itch. His image was
made like a human form, one side or flank of it being
painted yellow, and the other of a tawny color; down
each side of the face from the brow to the jaw a thin
stripe was wrought; and on the head was a little cap
with hanging tassels. The upper part of the body was
clothed with the flayed skin of a man; round the loins
was girt a kind of green skirt. It had on one arm a
yellow shield with a red border, and held in both hands
a scepter shaped like the calix of a poppy and tipped with
an arrow-head.<a id="FNanchor_IX-65" href="#Footnote_IX-65" class="fnanchor">[IX-65]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">EATING THE BODIES OF THE SACRIFICED.</p>

<p>On the last day of the second month&mdash;or, according
to some authors, of the first&mdash;Tlacaxipehualiztli,
there was celebrated a solemn feast in honor at once
of Xipetotec and of Huitzilopochtli. It was preceded
by a very solemn dance at noon of the day before.
As the night of the vigil fell, the captives were shut up
and guarded; at midnight&mdash;the time when it was usual
to draw blood from the ears&mdash;the hair of the middle of
the head of each was shaven away before a fire. When
the dawn appeared they were led by their owners to the
foot of the stairs of the temple of Huitzilopochtli&mdash;and
if they would not ascend willingly the priests dragged
them up by the hair. The priests threw them down one
by one on the back on a stone of three quarters of a
yard or more high, and square on the top something
more than a foot every way. Two assistants held the
victim down by the feet, two by the hands, and one by
the head&mdash;this last according to many accounts putting
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_413">413</a></span>
a yoke over the neck of the man and so pressing it down.
Then the priest, holding with both hands a splinter
of flint, or a stone resembling flint, like a large lance-head,
struck across the breast therewith, and tore out the
heart through the gash so made; which, after offering it
to the sun and other gods by holding it up toward the
four quarters of heaven, he threw into a wooden vessel.<a id="FNanchor_IX-66" href="#Footnote_IX-66" class="fnanchor">[IX-66]</a>
The blood was collected also in a vessel and given to the
owner of the dead captive, while the body, thrown down
the temple steps, was taken to the calpule by certain
old men, called <i>quaquacuiltin</i>, flayed, cut into pieces, and
divided for eating; the king receiving the flesh of the
thigh, while the rest of the carcass was eaten at the
house of the owner of the captive, though, as will appear
by a remark hereafter,<a id="FNanchor_IX-67" href="#Footnote_IX-67" class="fnanchor">[IX-67]</a> it is improbable that the captor
or owner himself ate any of it. With the skin of these
flayed persons, a party of youths called the <i>tototecli</i>
clothed themselves, and fought in sham fight with another
party of young men; prisoners being taken on both
sides, who were not released without a ransom of some
kind or other. This sham battle was succeeded by combats
of a terribly real sort, the famous so-called gladiatorial
fights of Mexico. On a great round stone, like an
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_414">414</a></span>
enormous mill-stone, a captive was tied by a cord, passing
round his waist and through the hole of the stone,
long enough to permit him freedom of motion everywhere
about the block&mdash;set near or at a temple called
<i>yopico</i>, of the god Totec, or Xipe.<a id="FNanchor_IX-68" href="#Footnote_IX-68" class="fnanchor">[IX-68]</a> With various ceremonies,
more particularly described in the preceding
volume, the bound man furnished with inferior weapons
was made to fight with a picked Mexican champion&mdash;the
latter holding up his sword and shield to the sun
before engaging. If, as sometimes happened, the desperate
though hampered and ill-armed captive&mdash;whose club-sword
was, by a refinement of mockery, deprived of its
jagged flint edging and set with feathers&mdash;slew his opponent,
another champion was sent against him, and so
on to the number of five, at which point, according to
some, the captive was set free; though according to other
authorities, he was not allowed so to escape, but champions
were sent against him till he fell. Upon which a
priest called the <i>yooallaoa</i> opened his breast, tore out his
heart, offered it to the sun, and threw it into the usual
wooden vessel; while the ropes used for binding to the
fighting-stone were carried to the four quarters of the
world, reverently with weeping and sighing. A second
priest thrust a piece of cane into the gash in the victim's
breast and held it up stained with blood to the sun.
Then the owner of the captive came and received the
blood into a vessel bordered with feathers; this vessel he
took with a little cane-and-feather broom or aspergillum
and went about all the temples and calpules, giving to each
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_415">415</a></span>
of the idols, as it were to taste of the blood of his captive.
The slain body was then carried to the calpulco&mdash;where,
while alive, it had been confined the night before the
sacrifice&mdash;and there skinned. Thence it was brought to
the house of its owner, who divided and made presents
of it to his superiors, relatives, and friends; not however
tasting thereof himself, for, we are told, "he counted it
as the flesh of his own body," because from the hour that
he took the prisoner "he held him to be his son, and the
captive looked up to his captor as to a father."</p>

<p class="sidenote">RELATIONS BETWEEN CAPTOR AND CAPTIVE.</p>

<p>The skins of the dead belonged to their captors, who
gave them again to others to be worn by them for apparently
twenty days, probably as a kind of penance&mdash;the
persons so clothed collecting alms from everyone in the
meantime and bringing all they got, each to the man
that had given him the skin. When done with, these
skins were hid away in a rotting condition in a certain
cave, while the ex-wearers thereof washed themselves
with great rejoicings. At the putting away of these
skins there assisted numbers of people ill with the itch
and such other diseases as Xipe inflicted&mdash;hoping thus
to be healed of their infirmities, and it is said that many
were so cured.<a id="FNanchor_IX-69" href="#Footnote_IX-69" class="fnanchor">[IX-69]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_416">416</a></span></p>

<p>The merchants of Mexico&mdash;a class of men who hawked
their goods from place to place and wandered often far
into strange countries to buy or sell&mdash;had various deities
to whom they did special honor. Among these the
chief, and often the only one mentioned, was the god
Yiacatecutli, or Jacateuctli, or Iyacatecuhtli, that is 'the
lord that guides,' otherwise called Yacacoliuhqui, or
Jacacoliuhqui.<a id="FNanchor_IX-70" href="#Footnote_IX-70" class="fnanchor">[IX-70]</a> This chief god of the merchants had,
however, according to Sahagun, five brothers and a sister,
also reverenced by traders, the sister being called
Chalmecacioatl, and the brothers respectively Chiconquiavitl,
Xomocuil, Nacxitl, Cochimetl, and Yacapitzaoac.
The principal image of this god was a figure representing
a man walking along a road with a staff; the face
black and white; the hair tied up in a bundle on the
middle of the top of the head with two tassels of rich
quetzal-feathers; the ear-rings of gold; the mantle blue,
bordered with a flowered fringe, and covered with a red
net, through whose meshes the blue appeared; round the
ankles leather straps from which hung marine shells;
curiously wrought sandals on the feet; and on the arm
a plain unornamented yellow shield, with a spot of light
blue in the centre of its field. Practically, however,
every merchant reverenced his own stout staff&mdash;generally
made of a solid, knotless piece of black cane, called
<i>utatl</i>&mdash;as the representative or symbol of this god Yiacatecutli;
keeping it, when not in use, in the oratory or
sacred place in his house, and invariably putting food
before it preliminary to eating his own meal. When
traveling the traders were accustomed nightly to stack
up their staves in a convenient position, bind them
about, build a fire before them,<a id="FNanchor_IX-71" href="#Footnote_IX-71" class="fnanchor">[IX-71]</a> and then offering blood
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_417">417</a></span>
and copal, pray for preservation and shelter from the
many perils to which their wandering life made them
especially subject.<a id="FNanchor_IX-72" href="#Footnote_IX-72" class="fnanchor">[IX-72]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">NAPATECUTLI.</p>

<p class="p2">Napatecutli, that is to say 'four times lord,' was the
god of the mat-makers and of all workers in water-flags
and rushes. A beneficent and helpful divinity, and one
of the Tlalocs, he was known by various names, such as
Tepahpaca Teaaltati, 'the purifier or washer;' Quitzetzelohua,
or Tlaitlanililoni, 'he that scatters or winnows
down;' Tlanempopoloa, 'he that is large and liberal;'
Teatzelhuia, 'he that sprinkles with water;' and Amotenenqua,
'he that shows himself grateful.' This god
had two temples in Mexico and his festival fell in the
thirteenth month, by Clavigero's reckoning. His image
resembled a black man, the face being spotted with white
and black, with tassels hanging down behind supporting
a green plume of three feathers. Round the loins and
reaching to the knees was girt a kind of white and black
skirt or petticoat, adorned with little sea-shells. The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_418">418</a></span>
sandals of this idol were white; on its left arm was a
shield made like the broad leaf of the water-lily, or nenuphar;
while the right hand held a sceptre like a
flowering staff, the flowers being of paper; and across
the body, passing under the left arm, was a white scarf,
painted over with black flowers.<a id="FNanchor_IX-73" href="#Footnote_IX-73" class="fnanchor">[IX-73]</a></p>

<p>The Mexicans had several gods of wine, or rather of
pulque; of these the chief seems to have been Tezcatzoncatl,
otherwise known as Tequechmecaniani 'the strangler,'
and as Teatlahuiani 'the drowner;' epithets
suggested by the effects of drunkenness. The companion
deities of this Aztec Dionysus were called as a class by
the somewhat extraordinary name of Centzontotochtin
or 'the four hundred rabbits'; Yiaulatecatl, Yzquitecatl,
Acoloa, Thilhoa, Pantecatl (the Patecatl of the interpreters
of the codices), Tultecatl, Papaztac, Tlaltecaiooa,
Ometochtli (often referred to as the principal god of
wine), Tepuztecatl, Chimapalnecatl, were deities of this
class. The principal characteristic of the image of the
Mexican god of drunkenness was, according to Mendieta
and Motolinia, a kind of vessel carried on the head of
the idol, into which vessel wine was ceremoniously
poured. The feast of this god, like that of the preceding
divinity, fell in the thirteenth month, Tepeilhuitl, and
in his temple in the city of Mexico there served four
hundred consecrated priests, so great was the service
done this everywhere too widely and well known god.<a id="FNanchor_IX-74" href="#Footnote_IX-74" class="fnanchor">[IX-74]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_419">419</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE HOUSEHOLD GODS.</p>

<p>The Mexicans had certain household gods called Tepitoton,
or Tepictoton, 'the little ones,'&mdash;small statues of
which kings kept six in their houses, nobles four, and
common folks two. Whether these were a particular
class of deities or merely miniature images of the already
described greater gods it is hard to say. Similar small
idols are said to have adorned streets, cross-roads, fountains
and other places of public traffic and resort.<a id="FNanchor_IX-75" href="#Footnote_IX-75" class="fnanchor">[IX-75]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">THE CEREMONIAL CALENDAR.</p>

<p class="p2">With these Tepitoton may be said to finish the list of
Mexican gods of any repute or any general notoriety; so
that it seems fit to give here a condensed and arranged
résumé of all the fixed festivals and celebrations of the
Aztec calendar, with its eighteen months of twenty
days each, and its five supplementary days at the end
of the year. There is some disagreement as to which of
the months the year began with; but it will best suit
our present purpose to follow the arrangement of Sahagun,
the interpreters of the Codices, Torquemada, and
Clavigero, in which the month variously called Atlcahualco,
or Quahuitlehua, or Cihuailhuitl, or Xilomanaliztli,
is the first.<a id="FNanchor_IX-76" href="#Footnote_IX-76" class="fnanchor">[IX-76]</a> The name Atlchualco, or Atlaooalo,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_420">420</a></span>
or Atalcaoplo, means 'the buying or scarcity of water;'
Quahuitlehua, or Quavitleloa, 'the sprouting of trees;'
and Xilomanaliztli, 'the offering of Xilotl (that is heads
of maize, which were then presented to the gods to secure
their blessing on the seed time).' This first month beginning
on the second of February according to Sahagun,
the eighteenth according to Gama, and the twenty-sixth
according to Clavigero, was consecrated to Tlaloc
and the other gods of water, and in it great numbers of
children were sacrificed.<a id="FNanchor_IX-77" href="#Footnote_IX-77" class="fnanchor">[IX-77]</a> In further honor of the Tlalocs
there were also at this time killed many captives on
the gladiatorial stone.</p>

<p>It was the second month, called Tlacaxiphualiztli,<a id="FNanchor_IX-78" href="#Footnote_IX-78" class="fnanchor">[IX-78]</a>
or 'the flaying of men,' that was specially famous for its
gladiatorial sacrifices, sacrifices already described and
performed to the honor of Xipe, or Xipetotec.<a id="FNanchor_IX-79" href="#Footnote_IX-79" class="fnanchor">[IX-79]</a></p>

<p>The third month called Tozoztontli, 'the lesser fast
or penance,' was inaugurated by the sacrifice on the
mountains of children to the Tlalocs. Those also that
traded in flowers and were called Sochimanque, or Xochimanqui,
made a festival to their goddess, Coatlycue,
or Coatlantona, offering her the first-fruits of the flowers
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_421">421</a></span>
of the year, of these that had grown in the precincts of
the cu <i>yapico</i>, a cu as we have seen, consecrated to Tlaloc.
Into a cave belonging to this temple there were also at
this time cast the now rotten skins of the human beings
that had been flayed in the preceding month. Thither,
"stinking like dead dogs," as Sahagun phrases it, marched
in procession the persons that wore these skins and there
they put them off, washing themselves with many ceremonies;
and sick folk troubled with certain skin-diseases
followed and looked on, hoping by the sight of all these
things to be healed of their infirmities. The owners of the
captives that had been slain had also been doing penance
for twenty days, neither washing nor bathing during
that time; and they now, when they had seen the
skins deposited in the cave, washed and gave a banquet to
all their friends and relatives, performing many ceremonies
with the bones of the dead captives. All the
twenty days of this month singing exercises, praising
the god, were carried on in the houses called Cuicacalli,
the performers not dancing but remaining seated.</p>

<p>The fourth month was called, in contradistinction to
the third, Veitozoztli, or Hueytozoztli, that is to say,
'the greater penance or letting of blood;' because in it
not only the priests but also the populace and nobility
did penance, drawing blood from their ears, shins, and
other parts of the body, and exposing at their doors
leaves of sword-grass stained therewith. After this they
performed certain already described ceremonies,<a id="FNanchor_IX-80" href="#Footnote_IX-80" class="fnanchor">[IX-80]</a>
and then made, out of the dough known as <i>tzoalli</i>,<a id="FNanchor_IX-81" href="#Footnote_IX-81" class="fnanchor">[IX-81]</a> an
image of the goddess Chicomecoatl, in the court-yard of
her temple, offering before it all kinds of maize, beans,
and chian, because she was the maker and giver of these
things and the sustainer of the people. In this month,
as well as in the three months preceding, little children
were sacrificed, a cruelty which was supposed to please
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_422">422</a></span>
the water gods, and which was kept up till the rains
began to fall abundantly.</p>

<p class="sidenote">THE MONTH TOXCATL.</p>

<p>The fifth month, called Toxcatl and sometimes Tepopochuiliztli,<a id="FNanchor_IX-82" href="#Footnote_IX-82" class="fnanchor">[IX-82]</a>
was begun by the most solemn and famous
feast of the year, in honor of the principal Mexican god,
a god known by a multitude of names and epithets,
among which were Tezcatlipoca, Titlacaoan, Yautl, Telpuchtli,
and Tlamatzincatl. A year before this feast,
one of the most distinguished of the captives reserved
for sacrifice was chosen out for superior grace and personal
appearance from among all his fellows, and given
in charge to the priestly functionaries called calpixques.
These instructed him with great diligence in all the arts
pertaining to good breeding, according to the Mexican
idea: such as playing on the flute, walking, speaking,
saluting those he happened to meet, the use and carrying
about of straight cane tobacco-pipes and of flowers,
with the dexterous smoking of the one, and the graceful
inhalation of the odor of the other. He was attended
upon by eight pages, who were clad in the livery
of the palace, and had perfect liberty to go where he
pleased night and day; while his food was so rich that
to guard against his growing too fat, it was at times
necessary to vary the diet by a purge of salt and water.
Everywhere honored and adored as the living image
and accredited representative of Tezcatlipoca, he went
about playing on a small shrill clay flute, or fife, and
adorned with rich and curious raiment furnished by
the king, while all he met did him reverence kissing
the earth. All his body and face was painted&mdash;black,
it would appear; his long hair flowed to the waist; his
head was covered with white hens' feathers stuck on
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_423">423</a></span>
with resin, and covered with a garland of the flowers
called <i>yzquisuchitl</i>; while two strings of the same flowers
crossed his body in the fashion of cross-belts. Earrings
of gold, a necklace of precious stones with a
great dependent gem hanging to the breast, a lip-ornament
(barbote) of sea-shell, bracelets of gold above
the elbow on each arm, and strings of gems called
<i>macuextli</i> winding from wrist almost to elbow, glittered
and flashed back the light as the doomed man-god
moved. He was covered with a rich beautifully
fringed mantle of netting, and bore on his shoulders
something like a purse made of white cloth of a span
square, ornamented with tassels and fringe. A white
maxtli of a span broad went about his loins, the two
ends, curiously wrought, falling in front almost to the
knee. Little bells of gold kept time with every motion
of his feet, which were shod with painted sandals called
<i>ocelunacace</i>.</p>

<p>All this was the attire he wore from the beginning
of his year of preparation; but twenty days before the
coming of the festival, they changed his vestments,
washed away the paint or dye from his skin, and cut
down his long hair to the length, and arranged it after
the fashion, of the hair of the captains, tying it up on the
crown of the head with feathers and fringe and two gold-buttoned
tassels. At the same time they married to him
four damsels, who had been pampered and educated for
this purpose, and who were surnamed respectively after
the four goddesses, Xochiquetzal, Xilonen, Atlatonan,
and Vixtocioatl.<a id="FNanchor_IX-83" href="#Footnote_IX-83" class="fnanchor">[IX-83]</a> Five days before the great day of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_424">424</a></span>
the feast,<a id="FNanchor_IX-84" href="#Footnote_IX-84" class="fnanchor">[IX-84]</a> the day of the feast being counted one, all
the people, high and low, the king it would appear being
alone excepted, went out to celebrate with the man-god
a solemn banquet and dance, in the ward called Tecanman;
the fourth day before the feast, the same was done
in the ward in which was guarded the statue of Tezcatlipoca.
The little hill, or island, called Tepetzinco, rising
out of the waters of the lake of Mexico, was the
scene of the next day's solemnities; solemnities renewed
for the last time on the next day, or that immediately
preceding the great day, on another like island called
Tepelpulco, or Tepepulco. There, with the four women
that had been given him for his consolation, the honored
victim was put into a covered canoe usually reserved
for the sole use of the king; and he was carried
across the lake to a place called Tlapitzaoayan, near
the road that goes from Yztapalapan to Chalco, at a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_425">425</a></span>
place where was a little hill called Acacuilpan, or
Cabaltepec. Here left him the four beautiful girls,
whose society for twenty days he had enjoyed, they
returning to the capital with all the people; there accompanying
the hero of this terrible tragedy only those
eight attendants that had been with him all the year.
Almost alone, done with the joys of beauty, banquet,
and dance, bearing a bundle of his flutes, he walked to
a little ill-built cu, some distance from the road mentioned
above, and about a league removed from the city.
He marched up the temple steps, not dragged, not
bound, not carried like a common slave or captive; and
as he ascended he dashed down and broke on every
step one of the flutes that he had been accustomed to
play on in the days of his prosperity. He reached the
top;&mdash;by sickening repetition we have learned to know the
rest; one thing only, from the sacrificial stone his body
was not hurled down the steps, but was carried by four
men down to the Tzompantli, to the place of the spitting
of heads.</p>

<p class="sidenote">THE FEAST OF TOXCATL.</p>

<p>And the chroniclers say that all this signified that
those who enjoyed riches, delights in this life, should at
the end come to poverty and sorrow&mdash;so determined are
these same chroniclers to let nothing escape without its
moral.</p>

<p>In this feast of Toxcatl, in the cu called Huitznahuac,
where the image of Huitzilopochtli was always kept, the
priests made a bust of this god out of <i>tzoalli</i> dough, with
pieces of mizquitl-wood inserted by way of bones. They
decorated it with his ornaments; putting on a jacket
wrought over with human bones, a mantle of very thin
<i>nequen</i>, and another mantle called the <i>tlaquaquallo</i>,
covered with rich feathers, fitting the head below and
widening out above; in the middle of this stood up a
little rod, also decorated with feathers and sticking into
the top of the rod was a flint knife half covered with
blood. The image was set on a platform made of pieces
of wood resembling snakes and so arranged that heads
and tails alternated all the way round; the whole borne
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_426">426</a></span>
by many captains and men of war. Before this image
and platform a number of strong youths carried an
enormous sheet of paper resembling pasteboard, twenty
fathoms long, one fathom broad, and a little less than an
inch thick; it was supported by spear-shafts arranged in
pairs of one shaft above and one below the paper, while
persons on either side of the paper held each one of
these pairs in one hand. When the procession, with
dancing and singing, reached the cu to be ascended, the
snaky platform was carefully and cautiously hoisted up
by cords attached to its four corners, the image was set
on a seat, and those that carried the paper rolled it up
and set down the roll before the bust of the god. It was
sunset when the image was so set up; and the following
morning every one offered food in his own house before
the image of Huitzilopochtli there, incensing also such
images of other gods as he had, and then went to offer
quails' blood before the bust set up on the cu. The king
began, wringing off the heads of four quails; the priests
offered next, then all the people; the whole multitude
carrying clay fire-pans and burning copal incense of
every kind, after which every one threw his live coals upon
a great hearth in the temple-yard. The virgins painted
their faces, put on their heads garlands of parched maize
with strings of the same across their breasts, decorated
their arms and legs with red feathers, and carried black
paper flags stuck into split canes. The flags of the
daughters of nobles were not of paper but of a thin cloth
called <i>canaoac</i>, painted with vertical black stripes. These
girls joining hands danced round the great hearth, upon
or over which on an elevated place of some kind there
danced, giving the time and step, two men, having each
a kind of pine cage covered with paper flags on his
shoulders, the strap supporting which passed, not across
the forehead&mdash;the usual way for men to carry a burden&mdash;but
across the chest as was the fashion with women.
The priests of the temple, dancing on this occasion with
the women, bore shields of paper, crumpled up like great
flowers; their heads were adorned with white feathers,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_427">427</a></span>
their lips and part of the face were smeared with sugar-cane
juice which produced a peculiar effect over the black
with which their faces were always painted. They
carried in their hands pieces of paper called <i>amasmaxtli</i>,
and sceptres of palm-wood tipped with a black flower
and having in the lower part a ball of black feathers.
In dancing they used this sceptre like a staff, and the
part by which they grasped it was wrapped round with
a paper painted with black lines. The music for the
dancers was supplied by a party of unseen musicians,
who occupied one of the temple buildings, where they sat,
he that played on the drum in the centre, and the performers
on the other instruments about him. The men
and women danced on till night, but the strictest order
and decency were preserved, and any lewd word or
look brought down swift punishment from the appointed
overseers.</p>

<p class="sidenote">DEATH OF THE YXTEUCALLI.</p>

<p>This feast was closed by the death of a youth who
had been during the past year dedicated to and taken
care of for Huitzilopochtli, resembling in this the victim
of Tezcatlipoca, whose companion he had indeed
been, but without receiving such high honors. This
Huitzilopochtli youth was entitled Yxteucalli, or Tlacabepan,
or Teicauhtzin, and was held to be the image
and representative of the god. When the day of his
death came, the priests decorated him with papers
painted over with black circles, and put a mitre of
eagles' feathers on his head, in the midst of whose
plumes was stuck a flint knife, stained half way up
with blood and adorned with red feathers. Tied to his
shoulders, by strings passing across the breast, was a
piece of very thin cloth about a span square, and over
it hung a little bag. Over one of his arms was thrown
a wild beast's skin, arranged somewhat like a maniple;
bells of gold jingled at his legs as he walked or danced.
There were two peculiar things connected with the
death of this youth; first he had absolute liberty of
choice regarding the hour in which he was to die; and
second, he was not extended upon any block or altar,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_428">428</a></span>
but when he wished he threw himself into the arms of
the priests, and had his heart so cut out. His head
was then hacked off and spitted alongside of that of
the Tezcatlipoca youth, of whom we have spoken already.
In this same day the priests made little marks
on children, cutting them, with thin stone knives, in
the breast, stomach, wrists, and fleshy part of the arms;
marks, as the Spanish priests considered, by which the
devil should know his own sheep.<a id="FNanchor_IX-85" href="#Footnote_IX-85" class="fnanchor">[IX-85]</a> The ceremonies of
the ensuing monthly festivals have already been described
at length.<a id="FNanchor_IX-86" href="#Footnote_IX-86" class="fnanchor">[IX-86]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">MISCELLANEOUS FEASTS.</p>

<p>There were, besides, a number of movable feasts in
honor of the higher gods, the celestial bodies, and the
patron deities of the various trades and professions.
Sahagun gives an account of sixteen movable feasts,
many of which, however, contained no religious element.<a id="FNanchor_IX-87" href="#Footnote_IX-87" class="fnanchor">[IX-87]</a>
The first was dedicated to the sun, to whom a
ghostly deputation of eighteen souls was sent to make
known the wants of the people, and implore future
favors. The selected victims were ranged in order at
the place of sacrifice, and addressed by the priest, who
exhorted them to bear in mind the sacred nature of
their mission, and the glory which would be theirs
upon its proper fulfillment. The music now strikes up;
amid the crash and din the victims one after another
are stretched upon the altar; a few flashes of the iztli-knife
in the practiced hand of the slayer, and the embassy
has set out for the presence of the sun.<a id="FNanchor_IX-88" href="#Footnote_IX-88" class="fnanchor">[IX-88]</a></p>

<p>The sixth, seventh, and eleventh festivals were celebrated
to Quetzalcoatl, Tezcatlipoca, and Huitzilopochtli
respectively. The public and household idols of these
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_429">429</a></span>
gods were at such seasons decorated, and presented with
offerings of food, quails, and incense. During the festival
of the god of fire, the thirteenth of the movable
feasts, various public officials were elected, and a great
many grand banquets given. The <i>atamalqualiztli</i>, or
'fast of bread and water,' seems to have been one of
the most important of the movable feasts. The people
prepared for its celebration, which took place every
eight years, by a rigid fast, broken only by a midday
meal of water and unsalted bread. Those who offended
the gods by neglecting to observe this fast were thought
to expose themselves to an attack of leprosy. The
people indulged in all sorts of amusements during the
holiday season which succeeded the fast. The most
interesting feature of the festivities was a bal masqué,
which was supposed to be attended by all the gods.
The chief honors of the day were, however, rendered
to the Tlalocs, and round their effigy, which stood in
the midst of a pond alive with frogs and snakes, the
dancers whirled continually. It was a part of the
ceremonies for a number of men called <i>maxatecaz</i> to
devour the reptiles in the pond; this they did by each
seizing a snake or a frog in his teeth, and swallowing it
gradually as he joined in the dance; the one who first
bolted his titbit cried out triumphantly, 'Papa, papa!'</p>

<p>Every fourth year, called <i>teoxihuitl</i>, or 'divine year,'
and at the beginning of every period of thirteen years,
the feasts were more numerous and on a larger scale,
the fasts more severe, and the sacrifices far greater in
number than upon ordinary occasions.<a id="FNanchor_IX-89" href="#Footnote_IX-89" class="fnanchor">[IX-89]</a> The entire
series of festivals may be said to have closed with the
solemn Toxilmolpilia, or 'binding up of the years,'
which took place every fifty-two years, and marked the
expiration and renewal of the world's lease of existence.<a id="FNanchor_IX-90" href="#Footnote_IX-90" class="fnanchor">[IX-90]</a></p>

</p>

<p>We have seen in the preceding volume that the number
of religious edifices was very great; that in addition
to the temples in the cities&mdash;and Mexico alone is said
to have contained two thousand sacred buildings&mdash;there
were "on every isolated hill, along the roads, and in
the fields, substantial structures consecrated to some
deity." Torquemada estimates the whole number at
eighty thousand.</p>

<p class="sidenote">TEMPLE REVENUES.</p>

<p>The vast revenues needed for the support and repair
of the temples, and for the maintenance of the immense
army of priests that officiated in them, were derived
from various sources. The greatest part was supplied
from large tracts of land which were the property of
the church, and were held by vassals under certain
conditions, or worked by slaves. Besides this, taxes of
wine and grain, especially first fruits, were levied upon
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_431">431</a></span>
communities, and stored in granaries attached to the
temples. The voluntary contributions, from a cake,
feather, or robe to slaves or priceless gems, given in performance
of a vow, or at the numerous festivals, formed
no unimportant item. Quantities of food were provided
by the parents of the children attending the schools,
and there were never wanting devout women eager to
prepare it. In the kingdom of Tezcuco, thirty towns
were required to provide firewood for the temples and
palaces;<a id="FNanchor_X-1" href="#Footnote_X-1" class="fnanchor">[X-1]</a> in Meztitlan, says Chaves, every man gave
four pieces of wood every five days; it is easy to believe
that the supply of fuel must have been immense, when
we consider that six hundred fires were kept continually
blazing in the great temple of Mexico alone.<a id="FNanchor_X-2" href="#Footnote_X-2" class="fnanchor">[X-2]</a> Whatever
surplus remained of the revenues after all expenses had
been defrayed, is said to have been devoted to the support
of charitable institutions and the relief of the poor;<a id="FNanchor_X-3" href="#Footnote_X-3" class="fnanchor">[X-3]</a>
in this respect, at least the Holy Mother Church of contemporary
Europe might have taken a lesson from her
pagan sister in the New World.</p>

<p>Each temple had its complement of ministers to
conduct and take part in the daily services, and of
servants to attend to the cleansing, firing, and other
menial offices. In the great temple at Mexico there
were five thousand priests and attendants,<a id="FNanchor_X-4" href="#Footnote_X-4" class="fnanchor">[X-4]</a> the total number
of the ecclesiastical host must therefore have been
immense; Clavigero places it at a million, which does
not appear improbable if we accept Torquemada's statement
that there were forty thousand temples as a basis
for the computation. It should be remembered, however,
that the sacerdotal body was not composed entirely
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_432">432</a></span>
of permanent members; some were merely engaged for
a certain number of years, in fulfillment of a vow made
by themselves or their parents; others were obliged to
attend at intervals only, or at certain festivals, the rest
of their time being passed in the pursuit of some profession,
usually that of arms.<a id="FNanchor_X-5" href="#Footnote_X-5" class="fnanchor">[X-5]</a></p>

<p>The vast number of the priests, their enormous wealth,
and the blind zeal of the people, all combined to render
the sacerdotal power extremely formidable. The king
himself performed the functions of high-priest on certain
occasions, and frequently held some sacred office
before succeeding to the throne. The heads of Church
and State seem to have worked amicably together, and
to have united their power to keep the masses in subjection.
The sovereign took no step of importance
without first consulting the high-priests to learn whether
the gods were favorable to the project. The people were
guided in the same manner by the inferior ministers, and
this influence was not likely to decrease, for the priests
as the possessors of all learning, the historians and poets
of the nation, were intrusted with the education of
the youth, whom they took care to mold to their
purposes.</p>

<p>At the head of the Mexican priesthood were two
supreme ministers; the Teotecuhtli or 'divine lord,'
who seems to have attended more particularly to secular
matters, and the Hueiteopixqui, who chiefly superintended
religious affairs. These ministers were elected,
ostensibly from among the priests most distinguished in
point of birth, piety, and learning; but as the king and
principal nobles were the electors, the preference was
doubtless given to those who were most devoted to their
interests, or to members of the royal family.<a id="FNanchor_X-6" href="#Footnote_X-6" class="fnanchor">[X-6]</a> They
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_433">433</a></span>
were distinguished by a tuft of cotton, falling down
upon the breast. Their robes of ceremony varied with
the nature of the god whose festival they celebrated.
In Tezcuco and Tlacopan, the pontifical dignity was
always conferred upon the second son of the king. The
Totonacs elected their pontiff from among the six chief
priests, who seem to have risen from the ranks of the
Centeotl monks; the ointment used at his consecration
was composed partly of children's blood. High as was
the high-priest's rank, he was not by any means exempt
from punishment; in Ichatlan, for instance, where
he was elected by his fellow-priests, if he violated his
vow of celibacy he was cut in pieces, and the bloody
limbs were given as a warning to his successor.<a id="FNanchor_X-7" href="#Footnote_X-7" class="fnanchor">[X-7]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">MEXICAN PRIESTHOOD.</p>

<p>Next in rank to the two Mexican high-priests was
the Mexicatlteohuatzin, who was appointed by them,
and seems to have been a kind of Vicar General. His
duties were to see that the worship of the gods was properly
observed throughout the kingdom, and to supervise
the priesthood, monasteries, and schools. His badge of
office was a bag of incense of peculiar shape. Two
coadjutors assisted him in the discharge of his duties;
the Huitzuahuacteohuatzin, who acted in his place when
necessary, and the Tepanteohuatzin, who attended
chiefly to the schools.<a id="FNanchor_X-8" href="#Footnote_X-8" class="fnanchor">[X-8]</a> Conquered provinces retained
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_434">434</a></span>
control over their own religious affairs.<a id="FNanchor_X-9" href="#Footnote_X-9" class="fnanchor">[X-9]</a> Among other
dignitaries of the church may be mentioned the Topiltzin,
who held the hereditary office of sacrificer, in
which he was aided by five assistants;<a id="FNanchor_X-10" href="#Footnote_X-10" class="fnanchor">[X-10]</a> the Tlalquimiloltecuhtli,
keeper of relics and ornaments; the Ometochtli,
composer of hymns; the Tlapixcatzin, musical
director; the Epcoaquacuiltzin, master of ceremonies;
the treasurer; the master of temple properties; and a
number of leaders of special celebrations. Besides these,
every ward, or parish, had its rector, who performed
divine service in the temple, assisted by a number of inferior
priests and school-children. The nobles kept private
chaplains to attend to the worship of the household
gods, which everyone was required to have in his dwelling.<a id="FNanchor_X-11" href="#Footnote_X-11" class="fnanchor">[X-11]</a>
The statement of some writers indicate that the
body of priests attached to the service of each god, was
to a certain extent independent, and governed by its
own rules. Thus in some wards the service of Huitzilopochtli
was hereditary, and held in higher estimation
than any other.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_435">435</a></span></p>

<p>The distinguishing dress of the ordinary priests was a
black cotton cloth, from five to six feet square, which
hung from the back of the head like a veil. Their hair,
which was never cut and frequently reached to the
knees, was painted black and braided with cord; during
many of their long fasts it was left unwashed, and it
was a rule with some of the more ascetic orders never
to cleanse their heads.<a id="FNanchor_X-12" href="#Footnote_X-12" class="fnanchor">[X-12]</a> Reed sandals protected their
feet. They frequently dyed their bodies with a black
mixture made of ocotl-root, and painted themselves
with ochre and cinnabar. They bathed every night in
ponds set apart for the purpose within the temple enclosure.
When they went out into the mountains to
sacrifice, or do penance, they anointed their bodies with
a mixture called <i>teopatli</i>, which consisted of the ashes of
poisonous insects, snakes, and worms, mixed with ocotl-soot,
tobacco, ololiuhqui, and sacred water. This filthy
compound was supposed to be a safeguard against snakebites,
and the attack of wild beasts.<a id="FNanchor_X-13" href="#Footnote_X-13" class="fnanchor">[X-13]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">MEXICAN PRIESTESSES.</p>

<p>Sacred offices were not occupied by males only; females
held positions in the temples, though they were
excluded from the sacrificial and higher offices. The
manner in which they were dedicated to the temple
school has been already described.<a id="FNanchor_X-14" href="#Footnote_X-14" class="fnanchor">[X-14]</a> Like the Roman
vestals, their chief duty seems to have been to tend the
sacred fires, though they were also required to place the
meat offerings upon the altar, and to make sacerdotal
vestments. The punishment inflicted upon those who
violated their vow of chastity was death. They were
divided into watches, and during the performance of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_436">436</a></span>
their duties were required to keep at a proper distance
from the male assistants, at whom they did not even dare
to glance.<a id="FNanchor_X-15" href="#Footnote_X-15" class="fnanchor">[X-15]</a></p>

<p>Of the several religious orders the most renowned for
its sanctity was the Tlamaxcacayotl, which was consecrated
to the service of Quetzalcoatl. The superior of
this order, who was named after the god, never deigned
to issue from his seclusion except to confer with the king.
Its members, called <i>tlamacaxqui</i>, led a very ascetic life,
living on coarse fare, dressing in simple black robes,<a id="FNanchor_X-16" href="#Footnote_X-16" class="fnanchor">[X-16]</a>
and performing all manner of hard work. They bathed
at midnight, and kept watch until an hour or two before
dawn, singing hymns to Quetzalcoatl; on occasions some
of them would retire into the desert to lead a life of
prayer and penance in solitude. Children dedicated to
this order were distinguished by a collar called <i>yanuati</i>,
which they wore till their fourth year, the earliest age
at which they were admitted as novices. The females
who joined these orders were not necessarily virgins, for
it seems that married women were admitted.<a id="FNanchor_X-17" href="#Footnote_X-17" class="fnanchor">[X-17]</a></p>

<p>The order of Telpochtiliztli, 'congregation of young
men,' was composed of youths who lived with their parents,
but met at sunset in a house set apart for them,
to dance and chant hymns in honor of their patron god,
Tezcatlipoca. Females also attended these meetings,
and, according to report, strict decorum was maintained,
at least while the services lasted.<a id="FNanchor_X-18" href="#Footnote_X-18" class="fnanchor">[X-18]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">RELIGIOUS DEVOTEES.</p>

<p>Acosta makes mention of certain ascetics who dedicated
themselves for a year to the most austere life;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_437">437</a></span>
they assisted the priests at the hours of incensing, and
drew much blood from their bodies in sacrifice. They
dressed in white robes and lived by begging.<a id="FNanchor_X-19" href="#Footnote_X-19" class="fnanchor">[X-19]</a> Camargo
refers to a similar class of penitents in Tlascala, who
called themselves <i>tlamaceuhque</i>, and sought to obtain
divine favor by passing from temple to temple at night,
carrying pans of fire upon their heads; this they kept
up for a year or two, during which time they led a very
strict life.<a id="FNanchor_X-20" href="#Footnote_X-20" class="fnanchor">[X-20]</a> The Totonacs had a very strict sect, limited
in number, devoted to Centeotl, to which none were
admitted but widowers of irreproachable character, who
had passed the age of sixty. It was they who made
the historical and other paintings from which the high-priest
drew his discourses. They were much respected
by the people, and were applied to by all classes for advice,
which they gave gravely, squatted upon their
haunches and with lowered eyes. They dressed in
skins, and ate no meat.<a id="FNanchor_X-21" href="#Footnote_X-21" class="fnanchor">[X-21]</a></p>

<p>The children, who were all required, says Las Casas,
to attend school between the ages of six and nine, rendered
valuable assistance to the priests by performing
the minor duties about the temple. Those of the lower
school performed much of the outside labor, such as
carrying wood and drawing water, while the sons of the
nobility were assigned higher tasks in the interior of
the building.<a id="FNanchor_X-22" href="#Footnote_X-22" class="fnanchor">[X-22]</a></p>

<p>The daily routine of temple duties was performed by
bodies of priests, who relieved each other at intervals
of a few hours or days. The service, which chiefly
consisted of hymn-chanting and incense-burning, was
performed four times each day, at dawn, noon, sunset,
and midnight. At the midnight service the priests
drew blood from their bodies and bathed themselves.
The sun received offerings of quails four times during
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_438">438</a></span>
the day, and five times during the night.<a id="FNanchor_X-23" href="#Footnote_X-23" class="fnanchor">[X-23]</a> The priests
of Quetzalcoatl sounded the hours of these watches
with shell-trumpets and drums. Thrice every morning
the Totonac pontiff wafted incense toward the sun;
after which the elder priests, who followed him in a
file, according to rank, waved their censers three times
before the principal idols, and once before the others;
finally, incense was burned in honor of the pontiff
himself. The copal that remained was distributed in
heaps upon the various altars. Later in the day, the
high-priest delivered a lecture before the priests
and nobles.<a id="FNanchor_X-24" href="#Footnote_X-24" class="fnanchor">[X-24]</a> Their prayers were standard compositions,
learned by rote at school;<a id="FNanchor_X-25" href="#Footnote_X-25" class="fnanchor">[X-25]</a> while reciting them,
they assumed a squatting posture,<a id="FNanchor_X-26" href="#Footnote_X-26" class="fnanchor">[X-26]</a> usually with the
face toward the east; on occasions of great solemnity
they prostrated themselves. A test was sometimes applied
to ascertain whether the deity was disposed to
respond to the prayers of the nation, when offered for
a particular purpose. This was done by sprinkling
snuff upon the altar, and if, shortly afterwards, the
foot-print of an animal, particularly that of an eagle,
was found impressed in the snuff, it was regarded as a
mark of divine favor, and great was the shouting when
the priest announced the augury.<a id="FNanchor_X-27" href="#Footnote_X-27" class="fnanchor">[X-27]</a></p>

<p>Many rites and ceremonies were found to exist
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_439">439</a></span>
among the civilized nations of America that were very
similar to certain others observed by Jews and Christians
in the old world. The innumerable speculators
on the origin of the aboriginal inhabitants of the new
world, or at least on the origin of their civilization,
have not neglected to bring forward these coincidences&mdash;there
is no good reason to suppose them anything
else&mdash;in support of their various theories.</p>

<p class="sidenote">BAPTISM AND CIRCUMCISION.</p>

<p>The cleansing virtue of water would naturally suggest
its adaptability to the purification of spiritual stains;
the priests and ascetics, plunging at midnight, with
their self-inflicted wounds unclosed, into the icy
pool within the temple inclosure, had this end in
view; there is therefore no cause to wonder that
baptism developed into an established rite. The fact
that infants were baptized immediately after birth,
proves that these people believed, with the Christians
and Jews, that sin is inherited; but this, to my
thinking at least, does not necessarily show that any
communication or connection of any kind ever took
place or existed between the inhabitants of the old
world and those of the new. They saw that life was
not all happiness; they saw that a man's suffering
begins at his birth; they were peculiarly apt to regard
every misfortune as a direct visitation of the offended
gods, whose anger they continually deprecated by prayer
and sacrifice; how, then, could they help but believe in
the inherency of sin&mdash;in the visiting of the sins of the
fathers upon the children&mdash;while the suffering entailed
upon irresponsible infancy was continually before them?</p>

<p>The rite of circumcision has been the main-stay of
the numerous theorists who have attempted to prove
that the native Americans are descended from the Jews;
but with the same evidence they may be proved to be
descended from the Caffirs, the South Sea Islanders, the
Ethiopians, the Egyptians, or from any Mohammedan
people, who all either have practiced, or do now practice
circumcision.<a id="FNanchor_X-28" href="#Footnote_X-28" class="fnanchor">[X-28]</a> Brinton thinks that the rite was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_440">440</a></span>
probably a symbolic renunciation of the lusts of the
flesh;<a id="FNanchor_X-29" href="#Footnote_X-29" class="fnanchor">[X-29]</a> but, as it would be difficult to find a more licentious
race than the American, this supposition is
unsatisfactory. After all, why need we grope among
the recesses of an obscure cult for the meaning and
origin of a custom which may have had no religious
ideas connected with it? We know that several of the
nations of the old world practiced circumcision merely
for purposes of cleanliness and convenience, why not
also the Americans?</p>

<p>A rite, analogous in some aspects to the Christian
communion, was observed on certain occasions. Thus,
in the fifteenth month, a dough statue of Huitzilopochtli
was broken up and distributed among the men;
this ceremony was called <i>teoqualo</i>, meaning 'the god is
eaten.' At other times, sacred cakes of amaranth-seeds
and honey, were stuck upon maguey-thorns and distributed.
Mendieta states that tobacco was eaten in
honor of Cihuacoatl. The Totonacs made a dough of
first-fruits from the temple garden, <i>ulli</i>, and the blood
of three infants sacrificed at a certain festival; of this
the men above twenty-five years of age, and the women
above sixteen, partook every six months; as the dough
became stale, it was moistened with the heart's blood of
ordinary victims.<a id="FNanchor_X-30" href="#Footnote_X-30" class="fnanchor">[X-30]</a> The rite of confession has been
already described.<a id="FNanchor_X-31" href="#Footnote_X-31" class="fnanchor">[X-31]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">FASTS AND PENANCE.</p>

<p>Fasting was observed as an atonement for sin, as well
as a preparation for solemn festivals. An ordinary fast
consisted in abstaining from meat for a period of from
one to ten days, and taking but one meal a day, at
noon; at no other hour might so much as a drop of
water be touched. In the 'divine year' a fast of eighty
days was observed. Some of the fasts held by the
priests lasted one hundred and sixty days, and, owing
to the insufficient food allowed and terrible mutilations
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_441">441</a></span>
practiced, these long feasts not unfrequently resulted
fatally to the devotees. The high-priest sometimes set
a shining example to his subordinates by going into the
mountains and there passing several months, in perfect
solitude, praying, burning incense, drawing blood from
his body, and supporting life upon uncooked maize.<a id="FNanchor_X-32" href="#Footnote_X-32" class="fnanchor">[X-32]</a></p>

<p>In Teotihuacan, four priests undertook a four years'
penance, which, if strictly observed, entitled them to be
regarded as saints forever after. A thin mantle and a
breech-clout were all the dress allowed them, no matter
what the weather might be; the bare ground was their
only bed, a stone their softest pillow; their noonday
and only meal was a two-ounce cake, and a small bowl
of porridge made of meal and honey, except on the
first of each month, when they were allowed to take
part in the general banquets. Two of them watched
every alternate night, drawing blood and praying.
Every twentieth day they passed twenty sticks through
the upper part of the ear; and these, Gomara solemnly
assures us, were allowed to accumulate from month to
month, so that at the end of the four years, the ear
held four thousand three hundred and twenty sticks,
which were burned in honor of the gods at the expiration
of the time of penance.<a id="FNanchor_X-33" href="#Footnote_X-33" class="fnanchor">[X-33]</a></p>

<p>Blood-drawing was the favorite and most common
mode of expiating sin and showing devotion. Chaves
says that the people of Meztitlan drew blood every five
days, staining pieces of paper with it, and offering them
to the god.<a id="FNanchor_X-34" href="#Footnote_X-34" class="fnanchor">[X-34]</a> The instruments used in ordinary scarification
were maguey-thorns, which were offered to the
idol, and afterwards burned, but for more severe discipline
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_442">442</a></span>
iztli knives were used, and cords or sticks were
passed through the tongue, ears, or genitals.</p>

<p class="sidenote">HUMAN SACRIFICES.</p>

<p>The offering most acceptable to the Nahua divinities
was human life, and without this no festival of any
importance was complete. The origin of the rite of
human sacrifice, as connected with sun-worship at least,
dates back to the earliest times. It is mentioned in the
story of the first appearance of the sun to the Mexicans,
which relates how that luminary refused to proceed
upon its daily circuit until appeased by the sacrifice of
certain heroes who had offended it.<a id="FNanchor_X-35" href="#Footnote_X-35" class="fnanchor">[X-35]</a> Some affirm that
human sacrifice was first introduced by Tezcatlipoca;
others again say that it was practiced before Quetzalcoatl's
time, which is likely enough, if, as we are told,
that prophet not only preached against it as an abomination,
but shut his ears with both hands when it was
even mentioned. Written, or painted, records show its
existence in 1091, though some native writers assert
that it was not practiced until after this date. The
nations that encompass the Aztecs ascribe the introduction
of human sacrifice to the latter people; a statement
accepted by most of the early historians, who
relate that the first human victims were four Xochimilcos,
with whose blood the newly erected altar of
Huitzilopochtli was consecrated.<a id="FNanchor_X-36" href="#Footnote_X-36" class="fnanchor">[X-36]</a></p>

<p>The number of human victims sacrificed annually in
Mexico is not exactly known. Las Casas, the champion
of the natives, places it at an insignificantly low figure,
while Zumárraga states that twenty thousand were sacrificed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_443">443</a></span>
in the capital alone every year. That the number
was immense we can readily believe, when we read in Torquemada,
Ixtlilxochitl, Boturini, and Acosta, that from
seventy to eighty thousand human beings were slaughtered
at the inauguration of the temple of Huitzilopochtli,
and a proportionately large number at the other celebrations
of the kind.<a id="FNanchor_X-37" href="#Footnote_X-37" class="fnanchor">[X-37]</a></p>

<p>The victims were mostly captives of war, and for the
sole purpose of obtaining these wars were often made; a
large proportion of the sacrificed, however, were of
slaves and children, either bought or presented for the
purpose, and condemned criminals. Moreover, instances
are not wanting of devout people offering themselves
voluntarily for the good of the people and the honor of
the god.<a id="FNanchor_X-38" href="#Footnote_X-38" class="fnanchor">[X-38]</a> The greater part of the victims died under
the knife, in the manner so often described;<a id="FNanchor_X-39" href="#Footnote_X-39" class="fnanchor">[X-39]</a> some,
however, were, as we have seen in the preceding
volume, burned alive; children were often buried, or
immured alive, or drowned; in some cases criminals
were crushed between stones. The Tlascaltecs frequently
bound the doomed one to a pole and made his body a
target for their spears and arrows.</p>

<p>It is difficult to determine what religious ideas were
connected with the almost universal practice of anthropophagy.
We have seen that several of the savage
tribes ate portions of slain heroes, thinking thereby to
inherit a portion of the dead man's good qualities; the
same reason might be assigned for the cannibalism of
the Aztecs, were it not for the fact that they ate the
flesh of sacrificed slaves and children as well as that of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_444">444</a></span>
warriors and notable persons. Whatever may have
been the original significance of the rite, it is most probable
that finally the body, the essence of which served
to regale the god, was regarded merely as the remains
of a divine feast, and, therefore, as sacred food. It is
quite possible, however, that religious anthropophagy
gradually degenerated into an unnatural appetite for
human flesh and nothing more.</p>

<p class="p2">I here close the review of the Aztec gods. Like most
of its branches, this great centre of North American
mythology rests on natural phenomena and anthropomorphic
creations, with an occasional euhemeristic development
or apotheosis, but is attended by a worship so
sanguinary and monstrous that it stands out an isolated
spectacle of the extreme to which fanatical zeal and
blind superstition can go. A glance at the Greek and
Roman mythology is sufficient to show how much purer
was the Nahua conception of divine character. The
Nahua gods did not, like those of Greece, play with
vice, but rather abhorred it. Tezcatlipoca is the only
deity that can be fairly compared with the fitful Zeus of
Homer&mdash;now moved with extreme passion, now governed
by a noble impulse, now swayed by brutal lust,
now drawn on by a vein of humor. But the polished
Greek, poetic, refined, full of ideas, exulting in his
strong, beautiful, immoral gods, and making his art immortal
by his sublime representations of them, presents
a picture very different from the Aztec, phlegmatic,
bloody-minded, ferocious, broken in body and in spirit
by the excesses of his worship, overshadowed by countless
terrors of the imagination, quaking continually
before gods who feast on his flesh and blood. Nevertheless
there was one bright spot, set afar off on the horizon,
upon which the Aztec might look and hope. Like the
Brahmans, the Buddhists, and the Jews, he looked forward
to a new era under a great leader, even Quetzalcoatl,
who had promised to return from the glowing
east, bringing with him all the prosperity, peace, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_445">445</a></span>
happiness of his former reign. The Totonacs, also,
knew of one in heaven who pleaded unceasingly for them
with the great god, and who was ultimately to bring
about a gentler era.</p>

<p class="sidenote p2">WORSHIP IN MICHOACAN.</p>

<p class="p2">Worship in Michoacan, though on a smaller scale, was
very similar to that in Mexico. The misty form of a
Supreme Being that hovers through the latter, here
assumes a more distinct outline, however. A First
Cause, a Creator of All, a Ruler of the World, who
bestows existence, and regulates the seasons, is recognized
in the god Tucapacha; an invisible being
whose abode is in the heaven above, an inconceivable
being whom no image can represent, a merciful
being to whom the people may hopefully pray.<a id="FNanchor_X-40" href="#Footnote_X-40" class="fnanchor">[X-40]</a> But
the very beauty and simplicity of the conception of
this god seem to have operated against the popularity
of his worship. The people needed a less shadowy personification
of their ideas, and this they found in Curicaneri,
originally the patron divinity of the Chichimec
rulers of the country, and by them exalted over Xaratanga,
the former head god of the Tarascos. Brasseur
de Bourbourg thinks Curicaneri to be identical with the
sun, and gives as his reason that the Chichimecs presented
their offerings first to that luminary and then to
the inferior deities. There is another point that seems
to favor this view. The insignia of Curicaneri and
Xaratanga were carried by the priests in the van of
the army to inspire courage and confidence of victory.
Before setting out on the march a fire was
lighted before the idol, and as the incense rose to
heaven, the priest addressed the god of fire, imploring
him to accept the offering and favor the expedition.<a id="FNanchor_X-41" href="#Footnote_X-41" class="fnanchor">[X-41]</a>
The image of Curicaneri was profusely adorned with
jewels, each one of which represented a human sacrifice
made in honor of the god.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_446">446</a></span></p>

<p>The goddess Xaratanga, though second in rank, seems
to have occupied the first place in the affections of the
Tarascos, in spite of the myth which associates her
name with the downfall of the native dynasty, saying
that she transformed their princes into snakes, because
they appeared drunk at her festivals, and thus afforded
the Chichimecs an opportunity to seize the sceptre.
The priests did their utmost, besides, to maintain her
prestige, and they were successful, as we have seen from
the position of the goddess by the side of Curicaneri, in
the van of the army.</p>

<p>Among the inferior gods were Manovapa, son of
Xaratanga, and Taras, from whom, says Sahagun,
the Tarascos took their name, and who corresponded
to the Mexican Mixcoatl. The Matlaltzincas worshiped
Coltzin, suffocating before his image the few
human beings offered to him. They reverenced very
highly, also, a great reformer, Surites, a high-priest,
who preached morality, and, inspired by a prophetic
spirit, is said to have prepared the people for a better
faith, which was to come from the direction of the
rising sun. The festivals of the Peranscuaro, which
corresponded to our Christmas, and the Zitacuarencuaro,
or 'resurrection,' were instituted by Surites. These
ideas, however, bear traces of having been 'improved'
by the padres.</p>

<p>The priests of Michoacan exercised even a greater influence
over the people than those of Mexico. In order
to retain this power they appealed to the religious side
of the people's character by thundering sermons and
solemn rites, and to their affections by practicing charity
at every opportunity. The king himself, when he paid
his annual visit to the high-priest to inaugurate the offering
of first-fruits, set an example of humility by kneeling
before the pontiff and reverently kissing his hand.
The priests of Michoacan formed a distinct class, composed
of three orders, at the head of which stood the
high priest of Curicaneri.<a id="FNanchor_X-42" href="#Footnote_X-42" class="fnanchor">[X-42]</a> Those who served the goddess
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_447">447</a></span>
Xaratanga were called <i>watarecha</i>, and were distinguished
by their shaven crowns, long black hair, and
tunics bordered with red fringe.<a id="FNanchor_X-43" href="#Footnote_X-43" class="fnanchor">[X-43]</a> Marriage was one of
their privileges.</p>

<p>The temple-service of Michoacan was much the same
as in Mexico. Human sacrifices, which seem to have
been introduced at a late period, were probably very
numerous, since hundreds of human victims were immolated
at the funeral of a monarch. The hearts of the
sacrificed were eaten by the priests, says Beaumont, and
this is not unlikely since the Otomí population of Michoacan
sold flesh in the public market. During seasons
of drought the Otomís sought to propitiate the rain gods
by sacrificing a virgin on the top of a hill.<a id="FNanchor_X-44" href="#Footnote_X-44" class="fnanchor">[X-44]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">WORSHIP IN JALISCO.</p>

<p>In Jalisco, several forms of worship appear, each with
its special divinities. These were mostly genii of natural
features. Thus, the towns about Chapala paid divine
honors to the spirit of the lake, who was represented by
a misshapen image with a miniature lake before it.
The people of other places had idols mounted on rocks,
or represented in the act of fighting with a wild animal
or monster. In Zentipac and Acaponeta the stars were
honored with offerings of the choicest fruit and flowers.
Equally innocent were the offerings brought to Piltzinteolli,
the 'child god,' whose youthful form was reared
in several places. An instance of apotheosis occurred
in Nayarit, where the skeleton of a king, enthroned in a
cave, received divine honors.</p>

<p>Among the temples consecrated to the various idols,
may be mentioned one in Jalisco, which was a square
pyramid, decorated with breast-work and turrets, to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_448">448</a></span>
which access was had by a staircase sixty feet in height.
At each of the four corners was a hearth so arranged that
the smoke from the sacred fire spread in a dense cloud
over the temple. Another, at Teul, consisted of a stone
building, five fathoms in length, by three in breadth,
and gradually widening towards the top. Two entrances,
one at the north corner, the other at the south, each
with five steps, gave admission to the interior; close by
were several piles, formed of the bones of the sacrificed.</p>

<p>The festivals which took place seem to have been disgraced
not only by excesses of the most infamous character,
but by the most horrible cruelties, if we are to
believe Oviedo, who writes of furnaces filled with charred
human remains. These sacrifices, however, if sacrifices
they were, which were common in the north-eastern
parts, where intercourse with Mexico had produced
many changes, do not appear as we advance southward.
Not only do they entirely vanish, but the chroniclers
state that in Colima, which was reputed to have been
at one time governed by a very wise prince, no outward
worship of any kind could be found; moreover, they
hint at an atheism having existed there, restricted only
by moral precepts. But the reality of an oasis of this
character, in the midst of the most degraded superstitions
and the wildest fanaticism, is at the least, doubtful, and
the work of the Fathers seems to be once more apparent.<a id="FNanchor_X-45" href="#Footnote_X-45" class="fnanchor">[X-45]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">WORSHIP IN OAJACA.</p>

<p>The worship of Oajaca bore even a stronger resemblance
to that of Mexico than did that of Michoacan, and
the assertion of some modern writers that both nations
have a common origin seems fully borne out by the
records of the old chroniclers. The array of gods was,
if possible, greater, for almost every feature of the grand,
wild scenery, every want, every virtue, even every vice,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_449">449</a></span>
says Burgoa, had one or more patron deities, to whom
offerings were made on the household altars. This was
especially the case in the upper district of Mizteca and
Zapoteca, where the rugged, cloud-capped peaks, dense
forests, boiling cataracts, and stealthy streams, all tended
to fill the crude mind of the native with a superstitious
awe that must have vent. Through all this may
be discerned the vague shape of a Supreme Being, bearing
many titles, such as Piyetao Piyexoo, 'one without
being,' Pitao Cozaana, 'creator of beings,' Wichaana,
'creator of men and fishes,' Coquiza-Chibataya Cozaanatao,
'the sustainer and governor of all,' and a multitude
of other titles, which merely serve to show how indefinite
was the position this Invisible One occupied in the
minds of a people unable to rise to a definite conception
of his eminence, and groveling before the hideous
gnomes bred of their own imagination.<a id="FNanchor_X-46" href="#Footnote_X-46" class="fnanchor">[X-46]</a></p>

<p>When the disciples of Quetzalcoatl, the Toltec god
and lawgiver, went forth at the command of their master
to preach his doctrines, some are said to have wended
their way to Oajaca, where they founded several centres
of worship,<a id="FNanchor_X-47" href="#Footnote_X-47" class="fnanchor">[X-47]</a> and among them Achiuhtla, the headquarters
of the Miztec religion, situated in the most rugged
part of the mountains. Here, in a cave the interior of
which was filled with idols, set up in niches upon stones
dyed with human blood and smoke of incense, was a
large transparent chalchiuite,<a id="FNanchor_X-48" href="#Footnote_X-48" class="fnanchor">[X-48]</a> entwined by a snake
whose head pointed toward a little bird perched on the
apex. This relic, worshiped since time immemorial
under the name of the 'heart of the people,' has all the
chief attributes of Quetzalcoatl; the stone, the emblem
of the air god, the snake and the bird; yet how mutilated
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_450">450</a></span>
the original myth, how much of its beautiful significance
gone! Burgoa invests the relic with another attribute
in making it the supporter of the earth, another Atlas in
fact, whose movements produce earthquakes. This also
accords with the character of Quetzalcoatl, who, under the
name of Huemac, was supposed to produce earthquakes.
The Zapotecs, besides, prayed to it for victory and wealth,
and Quetzalcoatl as the 'peace god,' could doubtless influence
the former, while the latter gift was always in his
power.<a id="FNanchor_X-49" href="#Footnote_X-49" class="fnanchor">[X-49]</a> In several other places were idols with the
same name, as at Yangüistlan, Chalcatongo, and Coatlan,
where the temples were caves, a fact worthy of note
when we consider that Quetzalcoatl is stated by the
myth to have erected temples to Mictlantecutli, the
Mexican Pluto.<a id="FNanchor_X-50" href="#Footnote_X-50" class="fnanchor">[X-50]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">VOTAN AND QUETZALCOATL.</p>

<p>The few authors, however, who have referred to this
relic, nearly all hold it to represent Votan; the old
writers doubtless because the name signifies 'heart'<a id="FNanchor_X-51" href="#Footnote_X-51" class="fnanchor">[X-51]</a>
in the Tzendal dialect of Chiapas, where he was the
most prominent deity, the modern, because its attributes
accord with those of this god. But Votan has so much
in common with Quetzalcoatl that some writers are inclined
to consider them identical, or at least related.
Müller, however, declares him to be an original Maya
snake-god, one of the thirteen chief snakes, to whom the
bird attribute was given at a late period, borrowed, perhaps,
from Quetzalcoatl. He is gradually anthropomorphized
into one of the many leaders whose names have
been given to the days of the month, Votan taking the
third of the four names that designated days as well as
years. Yet Professor Müller concedes that the god was
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_451">451</a></span>
brought from Cholula, and that certain special attributes
of Quetzalcoatl may be recognized in the figures on the
Palenque ruins, which probably refer to Votan; and further,
that a phase of the myth seems to point to him as
the grandson of Quetzalcoatl.<a id="FNanchor_X-52" href="#Footnote_X-52" class="fnanchor">[X-52]</a> Brasseur de Bourbourg,
while accepting his identity with the 'heart of the people,'
considers that the double aspect of the tradition
allows us to suppose that there were several Votans, or
that this name was accorded to deserving men who came
after him. At times he seems to be a mythic creation,
the mediator between man and God, the representation
of wisdom and power; at times a prince and legislator
who introduced a higher culture among his people. The
analogy presented by traditions between Votan, Gucumatz,
Cukulcan, and Quetzalcoatl, would lead us to believe
that one individual united in his person all these appellations.
Nevertheless, a comparison of the different traditions
admits of two, Votan and Quetzalcoatl, the other
names having the same signification as the latter.</p>

<p>It is certain, however, that from them, whether heroes,
priests, rulers, or warriors, Central America received
the culture which their successors brought to such perfection.
The knowledge of one supreme being appears
to have been among the first dogmas instilled into the
minds of their people; but in the tradition presented to
us, the hero's name is often confounded with that of the
divinities.<a id="FNanchor_X-53" href="#Footnote_X-53" class="fnanchor">[X-53]</a> Like Quetzalcoatl, Votan was the first historian
of his people, and wrote a book on the origin of the
race, in which he declares himself a snake, a descendant
of Imos, of the line of Chan, of the race of Chivim.<a id="FNanchor_X-54" href="#Footnote_X-54" class="fnanchor">[X-54]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_452">452</a></span>
One of his titles was 'lord of the hollow tree,' the tepahuaste,
or teponaztli.<a id="FNanchor_X-55" href="#Footnote_X-55" class="fnanchor">[X-55]</a></p>

<p>From the confused tradition of the Tzendals, as rendered
by Nuñez de la Vega and Ordoñez y Aguiar, it
seems that Votan, proceeded by divine command to
America and there portioned out the land.<a id="FNanchor_X-56" href="#Footnote_X-56" class="fnanchor">[X-56]</a> He accordingly
departed from Valum Chivim, passed by the 'dwelling
of the thirteen snakes,' and arrived in Valum Votan,<a id="FNanchor_X-57" href="#Footnote_X-57" class="fnanchor">[X-57]</a>
where he took with him several of his family to
form the nucleus of the settlement. With them he
passed through the island-strewn Laguna de Terminos,
ascended the Usumacinta, and here, on one of its tributaries
founded Nachan,<a id="FNanchor_X-58" href="#Footnote_X-58" class="fnanchor">[X-58]</a> or Palenque, the future metropolis
of a mighty kingdom, and one of the reputed cradles
of American civilization. The Tzendal inhabitants
bestowed upon the strange-looking new-comers the name
Tzequiles, 'men with petticoats,' on account of their long
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_453">453</a></span>
robes, but soon exchanged ideas and customs with them,
submitted to their rule, and gave them their daughters
in marriage. This event is laid a thousand years before
Christ.<a id="FNanchor_X-59" href="#Footnote_X-59" class="fnanchor">[X-59]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">TRAVELS OF VOTAN.</p>

<p>Ordoñez proceeds to say that Votan, after the establishment
of his government, made four or more visits to his
former home. On his first voyage he came to a great city,
wherein a magnificent temple was in course of erection;
this city Ordoñez supposed to be Jerusalem; he next visited
an edifice which had been originally intended to reach
heaven, an object defeated by a confusion of tongues;
finally he was allowed to penetrate by a subterranean
passage to the root of heaven.<a id="FNanchor_X-60" href="#Footnote_X-60" class="fnanchor">[X-60]</a> On returning to Palenque,
Votan found that several more of his nations had
arrived; these he recognized as snakes, and showed them
many favors, in return for which his supremacy was
made secure, and he was at last apotheosized.<a id="FNanchor_X-61" href="#Footnote_X-61" class="fnanchor">[X-61]</a> Among
the monuments left by the hero was a temple on the
Huehuetan River, called 'house of darkness,' from its
subterranean chambers, where the records of the nation
were deposited under the charge of a fixed number of
old men, termed <i>tlapianes</i>, or guardians, and an order of
priestesses, whose superior was likewise the head of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_454">454</a></span>
male members. Here were also kept a number of tapirs,
a sacred animal among the people.<a id="FNanchor_X-62" href="#Footnote_X-62" class="fnanchor">[X-62]</a></p>

<p>The claims of Votan to be considered as the 'heart of the
people,' are supported, according to the above accounts,
chiefly by his name, which means 'heart,' and by the fact
that a chalchiuite, of which stone the relic was made, was
placed by the Mexicans and other peoples between the
lips of deceased. The other attributes accord more with
the character of Quetzalcoatl, as we have seen, and the
tradition is very similar; its confusion goes to show that
it is a mutilated version of the Toltec myth. If we
accept Votan as a grandson of Quetzalcoatl we may also
suppose that he was one of the disciples sent out by the
prophet to spread his doctrines, and that his own name
has been substituted for that of his master. This view
is favored by the fact that Quetzalcoatl is identified with
the snake-heroes of Yucatan and Guatemala, countries
that lie beside and beyond Chiapas. Then, again, we
find that Votan's worship was known in Cholula, and
that he landed in the very region where the former hero
disappeared. However doubtful the preceding tradition
may be, there is one among the Oajacans, which to me
has all the appearance of a mutilated version of the
myth of Quetzalcoatl, deformed still more by the orthodox
Fathers. In very remote times, about the era of
the apostles, according to the padres, an old white man,
with long hair and beard, appeared suddenly at Huatulco,
coming from the south-west by sea, and preached to
the natives in their own tongue, but of things beyond
their understanding. He lived a strict life, passing the
greater part of the night in a kneeling posture, and eating
but little. He disappeared shortly after as mysteriously
as he had come, but left as a memento of his visit
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_455">455</a></span>
a cross, which he planted with his own hand, and admonished
the people to preserve it sacredly, for one day
they would be taught its significance.<a id="FNanchor_X-63" href="#Footnote_X-63" class="fnanchor">[X-63]</a> Some authors
describe a personage of the same appearance and character,
coming from the same quarter, and appearing in the
country shortly after, but it is doubtless the same old
man, who, on leaving Huatulco, may have turned his
steps to the interior. His voice is next heard in Mictlan,<a id="FNanchor_X-64" href="#Footnote_X-64" class="fnanchor">[X-64]</a>
inveighing in gentle but firm accents against the
pleasures of this world, and enjoining repentance and
expiation. His life was in strict accordance with his
doctrines, and never, except at confession, did he approach
a woman. But the lot of Wixepecocha, as the
Zapotecs call him, was that of most reformers. Persecuted
by those whose vice and superstitions he attacked,
he was driven from one province to another, and at last
took refuge on Mount Cempoaltepec. Even here his
pursuers followed him, climbing its craggy sides to lay
hands upon the prophet. Just as they reached the summit,
he vanished like a shadow, leaving only the print
of his feet upon the rock.<a id="FNanchor_X-65" href="#Footnote_X-65" class="fnanchor">[X-65]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE APOSTLE WIXEPECOCHA.</p>

<p>Among the points in this myth that correspond to the
character of Quetzalcoatl may be noticed the appearance
of the prophet from the south-west, which agrees with
the direction of the moisture-bearing winds, the chief
attribute of the Toltec god; the cross, which indicates
not only the four winds, but the rain of which they are
the bearers, attributes recognized by the Mexicans who
decorated the mantle of the god with crosses; the long
beard, the white face, and the dress, which all accord
with the Toltec Quetzalcoatl. Like him Wixepecocha
taught gentle doctrines of reform, like him he was persecuted
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_456">456</a></span>
and forced to wander from place to place, and at
last disappeared, leaving his followers the hope of a better
future. The doctrine of Wixepecocha, took root and
flourished in the land he had consecrated with his toils
and prayers, and, according to Brasseur de Bourbourg,
Wiyatao, the pontiff of Zapotecapan, was vicar and successor
of the 'prophet of Monapostiac.'<a id="FNanchor_X-66" href="#Footnote_X-66" class="fnanchor">[X-66]</a></p>

<p>The early padres saw in this personage none other
than St. Thomas, the apostle, who had walked across
to plant the cross and prepare the way for christianity.
There is, or was until recently, a statue of him in the
village of Magdalena, four leagues from Tehuantepec,
which represented him with long white beard, and
muffled up in a long robe with a hood, secured by a cord
round the waist; he was seated in a reflective attitude,
listening to the confession of a woman kneeling by his
side.<a id="FNanchor_X-67" href="#Footnote_X-67" class="fnanchor">[X-67]</a> A similar statue is mentioned by Burgoa, as
having existed in a cave not far from Xustlahuaca, in
Mistecapan,<a id="FNanchor_X-68" href="#Footnote_X-68" class="fnanchor">[X-68]</a> where it stood near the entrance, on a marble
monolith eleven feet in height. The approach to the
cavern appears to have formerly led through a beautiful
garden; within were masses of stalactite of the most
fantastic and varied forms, many of which the people
had fashioned into images of different kinds, and of the
most artistic execution, says the padre, whose fancy was
doubtless aided by the twilight within. Here lay the
embalmed bodies of kings and pontiffs, surrounded by treasures,
for this was a supposed entrance to the flowered
fields of heaven. The temple cave at Mictlan bore a
similar reputation, and served as a sepulchre for the
Zapotec grandees. It consisted of four chief divisions,
the largest forming the sanctuary proper, the second and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_457">457</a></span>
third the tombs of kings and pontiffs, and the fourth a
vestibule to an immense labyrinthine grotto, in which
brave warriors were occasionally buried. Into this, the
very ante-room of paradise, frenzied devotees would at
times enter, and seek in its dark mazes for the abode of
the gods; none ever returned from this dread quest, for
the entrance was closed with a great stone, and doubtless
many a poor wretch as he touched in his last feeble
gropings the bones of those who had preceded him, felt
the light come in upon his soul in spite of the thick
darkness, and knew he had been deluded; but the
mighty stone at the mouth of the cave told no secrets.<a id="FNanchor_X-69" href="#Footnote_X-69" class="fnanchor">[X-69]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">GODS OF OAJACA.</p>

<p>The prominence of the Plutonic element in the worship
of Oajaca is shown by the fact that Pezelao, whose
character corresponded to that of the Mexican Mictlantecutli,
received high honors. The other conspicuous
gods, as enumerated by Brasseur de Bourbourg, were
Pitao-Cocobi, god of abundance, or of the harvest; Cociyo,
the rain god; Cozaana, patron of hunters and fishermen;
and Pitao-Xoo, god of earthquakes. Other deities controlled
riches, misfortunes, auguries, poetic inspiration&mdash;even
the hens had their patron divinity. As might be
expected of a people who regarded even living kings and
priests with adoration, apotheosis was common. Thus,
Petela, an ancient Zapotec cacique whose name signified
dog, was worshiped in the cavern of Coatlan. At one
end of this subterranean temple a yawning abyss received
the foaming waters of a mountain torrent, and
into this slaves and captives, gaily dressed and adorned
with flowers, were cast on certain occasions.<a id="FNanchor_X-70" href="#Footnote_X-70" class="fnanchor">[X-70]</a></p>

<p>At another place was a white stone shaped like a nine-pin,
supposed to be the embodiment of Pinopiaa, a saintly
princess of Zapotecapan, whose corpse had been miraculously
conveyed to heaven and returned in this form for
the benefit of the devout.<a id="FNanchor_X-71" href="#Footnote_X-71" class="fnanchor">[X-71]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_458">458</a></span></p>

<p>In Chiapas they worshiped Costahuntox, who was represented
with ram's horns on his head, and sat on a
throne surrounded by thirteen grandees. In the district
of Llanos, Yabalan, or Yahalan, and Canamlum were
the chief gods. Even living beings held the position of
deities, according to Diaz, who states that a fat old
woman, dressed in richly decorated robes, whom the
natives venerated as a goddess, led them against the
Spanish invaders, but was killed.<a id="FNanchor_X-72" href="#Footnote_X-72" class="fnanchor">[X-72]</a> Among the Mijes a
green flat stone, with blood-red, lustrous rays, was held
in much veneration. Although this is the only reference
made by the chroniclers that may be connected with sun
worship&mdash;which, by the way, could scarcely have claimed
a very high position here, since the founder of the Miztec
royal family is stated to have been victorious in a
contest with the sun&mdash;it is worthy of note that the Zapotec
word <i>nuhu</i>, fire, also denotes divinity, idol, everything
sacred, the earth itself.<a id="FNanchor_X-73" href="#Footnote_X-73" class="fnanchor">[X-73]</a> The household idols had their
names, history, and worship depicted on bark, and
smoked or painted hides, in order to keep them always
before the people, and insure to the youth a knowledge
of their god. How firmly rooted idolatry was, and how
slow the work of eradicating it must have been,
to the padres, notwithstanding they destroyed every
idol they could lay hands on, is shown by the fact
that among the Guechecoros a statue of Cortés served
as an object of worship.<a id="FNanchor_X-74" href="#Footnote_X-74" class="fnanchor">[X-74]</a> Nagualism is one of the
ancient forms of worship which still flourish, and consists
in choosing an animal as the tulelary divinity of child,
whose existence will be so closely connected with it, that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_459">459</a></span>
the life of one depends on that of the other. Burgoa
states that the priest selected the animal by divination;
when the boy grew up he was directed to proceed to a
mountain to offer sacrifice, and there the animal would
appear to him. Others say that at the hour of the
mother's confinement, the father and friends drew on
the floor of the hut the outline of various animals, effacing
each figure as soon as they began the next, and the
figure that remained at the moment of delivery represented
the guardian of the infant; or, that the bird or
beast first seen by the watchers after the confinement
was accepted as the nagual. The bestowal of the sign of
the day upon the infant as its name may perhaps be considered
as a species of nagualism, since the name of animals
often formed these signs.<a id="FNanchor_X-75" href="#Footnote_X-75" class="fnanchor">[X-75]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">TREE WORSHIP.</p>

<p>A form of worship particularly marked in this country
was the veneration accorded to trees, as may be judged
from the myth which attributes the origin of the Miztec,
as well as a portion at least of the Zapotec people to two
trees. This cult existed also in other parts of Mexico
and Central America, where cypresses and palms growing
near the temples, generally in groups of three, were
tended with great care, and often received offerings of
incense and other gifts. They do not, however, seem
to have been dedicated to any particular god, as among
the Romans, where Pluto claimed the cypress, and Victory
the palm. One of the most sacred of these relics is
a cypress standing at Santa María de Tule, the venerable
trunk of which measures ninety feet in circumference, at
a height of six feet from the ground.<a id="FNanchor_X-76" href="#Footnote_X-76" class="fnanchor">[X-76]</a></p>

<p>One of the chief offerings of the Zapotecs was the blood
of the, to them sacred, turkey; straws and feathers
smeared with blood from the back of the ear, and from
beneath the tongue of persons, also constituted a large portion
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_460">460</a></span>
of the sacred offerings, and were presented in special
grass vessels. Human sacrifices were not common with
the Oajacan people, but in case of emergency, captives
and slaves were generally the victims. The usual mode
of offering them was to tear out the heart, but in some
places, as at Coatlan, they were cast into an abyss.
Herrera states that men were offered to the gods, women
to goddesses, and children to inferior deities, and that
their bodies were eaten, but the latter statement is doubtful.<a id="FNanchor_X-77" href="#Footnote_X-77" class="fnanchor">[X-77]</a></p>

</p>

<p>The religion of the Mayas was fundamentally the same
as that of the Nahuas, though it differed somewhat in
outward forms. Most of the gods were deified heroes,
brought more or less prominently to the front by their
importance. Occasionally we find very distinct traces
of an older sun-worship, which has succumbed to later
forms, introduced, according to vague tradition, from
Anáhuac. The generality of this cult is testified to by
the numerous representations of sun-plates and sun-pillars
found among the ruins of Central America.<a id="FNanchor_XI-1" href="#Footnote_XI-1" class="fnanchor">[XI-1]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_462">462</a></span></p>

<p>In Yucatan, Hunab Ku, 'the only god', called also
Kinehahau, 'the mouth or eyes of the sun',<a id="FNanchor_XI-2" href="#Footnote_XI-2" class="fnanchor">[XI-2]</a> is represented
as the Supreme Being, the Creator, the Invisible
one, whom no image can represent.<a id="FNanchor_XI-3" href="#Footnote_XI-3" class="fnanchor">[XI-3]</a> His spouse Ixazalvoh
was honored as the inventor of weaving, and their
son Zamná, or Yaxcocahmut, one of the culture-heroes
of the people, is supposed to have been the inventor of
the art of writing.<a id="FNanchor_XI-4" href="#Footnote_XI-4" class="fnanchor">[XI-4]</a> The inquiries instituted by Las
Casas revealed the existence of a trinity, the first person
of which was Izona, the Great Father; the second
was the Son of the Great Father, Bacab, born of the
virgin Chibirias,<a id="FNanchor_XI-5" href="#Footnote_XI-5" class="fnanchor">[XI-5]</a> scourged and crucified, he descended
into the realms of the dead, rose again the third day,
and ascended into heaven; the third person of the trinity
was Echuah, or Ekchuah, the Holy Ghost.<a id="FNanchor_XI-6" href="#Footnote_XI-6" class="fnanchor">[XI-6]</a> Now, to
accuse the reverend Fathers of deliberately concocting
this and other statements of a similar character is to accuse
them of acts of charlatanism which no religious
zeal could justify. On the other hand, that this mysterious
trinity, had any real existence in the original
belief of the natives, is, to put it in its mildest form,
exceedingly doubtful. It may be, however, that the
natives, when questioned concerning their religion,
endeavored to make it conform as nearly as possible
to that of their conquerors, hoping by this means to
gain the good will of their masters, and to lull suspicions
of lurking idolatry.</p>

<p>Bacab, stated above to mean the Son of the Great
Father, was in reality the name of four spirits who supported
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_463">463</a></span>
the firmament; while Echuah, or the Holy
Ghost, was the patron god of merchants and travelers.</p>

<p class="sidenote">ZAMNÁ.</p>

<p>The goddess Ixcanleox was held to be the mother of
the gods, but as Cogolludo states that she had several
names, she may possibly be identical with Ixazaluoh,
the wife of Hunab Ku, whose name implies generation.<a id="FNanchor_XI-7" href="#Footnote_XI-7" class="fnanchor">[XI-7]</a>
The Mayas were not behind their neighbors in the number
of their lesser and special divinities, so that there
was scarcely an animal or imaginary creature which they
did not represent by sacred images. These idols, or
<i>zemes</i>,<a id="FNanchor_XI-8" href="#Footnote_XI-8" class="fnanchor">[XI-8]</a> as they were called, were generally made of terra
cotta, though sometimes they were of stone, gold, or
wood. In the front rank of the circle of gods, known
by the name of <i>ku</i>, were the deified kings and heroes,
whom we often find credited with attributes so closely
connected as to imply identity, or representation of
varied phases of the same element.<a id="FNanchor_XI-9" href="#Footnote_XI-9" class="fnanchor">[XI-9]</a> The most popular
names were Zamná and Cukulcan, both culture-heroes,
and considered by some to be identical; a very probable
supposition when we consider that Quetzalcoatl, who is
admitted to be the same as Cukulcan, had the attribute
of the strong hand, as well as Zamná. The tradition
relates that some time after the fall of the Quinamean
Empire, Zamná appeared in Yucatan, coming from the
west, and was received with great respect wherever he
stayed. Besides being the inventor of the alphabet, he
is said to have named all points and places in the
country. Over his grave rose a city called Izamal
or Itzamat Ul, which soon became one of the chief centres
of pilgrimage in the peninsula, especially for the
afflicted, who sincerely believed that their prayers when
accompanied by suitable presents would not fail to obtain
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_464">464</a></span>
a hearing. This class of devotees generally resorted to
the temple where he was represented in the form of a
hand, Kab Ul, or working hand, whose touch was sufficient
to restore health.<a id="FNanchor_XI-10" href="#Footnote_XI-10" class="fnanchor">[XI-10]</a></p>

<p>Professor Müller thinks it very uncertain whether the
creating or working hand referred to the sun, as was the
case among the northern tribes, but the account given
of the following idol seems to me to make this not improbable.
In the same city was an image of Kinich
Kakmo, 'face or eye of the sun', whom Landa represents
to be the offspring of the sun, but who subsequently became
identified with that luminary and received divine
honors in the very temple that he had erected to his
father. He is represented in the act of sacrifice, pointing
the finger toward a ray from the midday sun, as if
to draw a spark wherewith to kindle the sacred fire. To
this idol the people resorted in times of calamity and
sickness, bringing offerings to induce oracular advice.<a id="FNanchor_XI-11" href="#Footnote_XI-11" class="fnanchor">[XI-11]</a>
There are many things which seem to me to identify
this personage with Zamná, although other writers hold
them to be distinct. Cogolludo, for instance, implies
that Zamná was the only son of the sun, or Supreme
Being, while Landa and others declare Kinich Kakmo
to be the son of that luminary; both are placed on or
about the same level and considered as healers, and the
uplifted hand of the latter reminds us strongly of the
Kab Ul. Another form in which we may recognize
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_465">465</a></span>
Zamná is the image of Itzamat Ul, or 'the dew of heaven',
who is said to have been a great ruler, the son of god,
and who cured diseases, raised the dead, and pronounced
oracles. When asked his name, he replied, <i>ytzencaan</i>,
<i>ytzenmuyal</i>.<a id="FNanchor_XI-12" href="#Footnote_XI-12" class="fnanchor">[XI-12]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">CUKULCAN.</p>

<p>The other culture-hero, Cukulcan, appeared in Yucatan
from the west, with nineteen followers, two of whom
were gods of fishes, two gods of farms, and one of thunder,
all wearing full beard, long robes, and sandals, but
no head-covering. This event is supposed to have occurred
at the very time that Quetzalcoatl disappeared in
the neighboring province of Goazacoalco, a conjecture
which, in addition to the similarity of the names,
character, and work of the heroes, forms the basis for
their almost generally accepted identity. Cukulcan
stopped at several places in Yucatan, but at last settled
in Chichen Itza, where he governed for ten years, and
framed laws. At the expiration of this period, he left
without apparent reason to return to the country whence
he had come. A grateful people erected temples at
Mayapan and Chichen, to which pilgrims resorted from
all quarters to worship him as a god, and to drink of
the waters in which he had bathed. His worship, although
pretty general throughout Yucatan at one time,
was later on confined chiefly to the immediate scenes of
his labors.<a id="FNanchor_XI-13" href="#Footnote_XI-13" class="fnanchor">[XI-13]</a></p>

<p>

<p>Besides Izamal and Chichen, there was a third great
centre of worship in Yucatan, namely, the temple of
Ahulneb, on Cozumel Island, said by some writers to
have been the chief sanctuary, Chichen being second in
importance. It consisted of a square tower of considerable
size, within which was the gigantic terra-cotta statue
of Ahulneb, dressed as a warrior, and holding an arrow
in his hand. The statue was hollow and set up close
against an aperture in the wall, by which the priest entered
the figure to deliver the oracle; should the prediction
not be fulfilled, which was scarcely likely as it was
generally so worded that it might mean anything or
nothing, the failure was ascribed to insufficient sacrifice
or unatoned sin. So famous did this oracle become,
and so great was the multitude of pilgrims continually
flocking to it, that it was found necessary to construct
roads leading from the chief cities of Yucatan, and even
from Tabasco and Guatemala, to Polé, a town on the
continent opposite the island. Before embarking, the
genius of the sea was always propitiated by the sacrifice
of a dog, which was slain with arrows amid music and
dancing.<a id="FNanchor_XI-14" href="#Footnote_XI-14" class="fnanchor">[XI-14]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">YUCATEC DEITIES.</p>

<p>The Bacabs were four brothers who supported the
four corners of the firmament; they were also regarded
as air gods. Cogolludo speaks of them as Zacal Bacab,
Canal Bacab, Chacal Bacab, and Ekel Bacab, but they
were also known by other names. Echuah was the
patron-god of merchants and of roads; to him the traveler
erected every night a rude altar of six stones, three
laid flat, and three set upright, upon which he burned
incense while he invoked the protection of the god. It
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_467">467</a></span>
was considered a religious duty by Yucatec wayfarers,
when passing some prominent point on the road or spot
where an image of Echuah stood, to add a stone or two
to the heap already accumulated there, an act of devotion
similar to that performed by the Romans in honor
of Mercury. Yuncemil was Lord of Death, or, perhaps,
the personification of death itself; this dread deity was
propitiated with offerings of food.<a id="FNanchor_XI-15" href="#Footnote_XI-15" class="fnanchor">[XI-15]</a> Acat was God of
Life; he it was that formed the infant in the womb. At
Tihoo, the present Mérida, stood the magnificent temple
of Yahau Kuna in which Baklum Chaam, the Priapus
of the Mayas and their most ancient god was worshiped.
Chac, or Chaac, a former king of Izamal, was honored
as the god of fields, and fertility, and the inventor of
agriculture. Some distance south-west of this city was
the temple of Hunpictok, 'commander of eight thousand
lances', a title given also to the general of the army.<a id="FNanchor_XI-16" href="#Footnote_XI-16" class="fnanchor">[XI-16]</a>
Abchuy Kak was another apotheosized warrior-prince,
whose statue, dressed in royal robes, was borne in the
van of the army by four of the most illustrious captains,
and received an ovation all along the route. Yxchebelyax
is mentioned as the inventor of the art of interweaving
figures in cloth, and of painting. Xibalba, 'he
who disappears,' was the name of the evil spirit. Exquemelin
relates that nagualism obtained on the coast.
The naked child was placed on a bed of ashes in the
temple, and the animal whose footprint was noticed in
the ashes, was adopted as the nagual, and to it the child
offered incense as it grew up.<a id="FNanchor_XI-17" href="#Footnote_XI-17" class="fnanchor">[XI-17]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_468">468</a></span></p>
<p class="sidenote p2">SYMBOL OF THE CROSS.</p>

<p class="p2">One of the most remarkable emblems of Maya
worship, in the estimation of the conquerors, was the
cross, which has also been noticed in other parts of Central
America and in Mexico,<a id="FNanchor_XI-18" href="#Footnote_XI-18" class="fnanchor">[XI-18]</a> although less prominently
than here. Among the many conjectures as to its origin it
is supposed that it was received from Spaniards who
were wrecked on the coast before Córdova discovered
Yucatan, as, for instance, the pious Aguilar, Cortés' interpreter;
but this would not account for the crosses that
existed in other parts of Central America. The natives
had a tradition, however, which placed the introduction
of the cross a few years before the conquest. Among
the many prophets who arose at that time was one who
predicted the coming of a strange people from the direction
of the rising sun, who would bring with them
a monotheistic faith having the cross for its emblem.
He admonished them to accept the new religion, and
erected a cross as a token of his prophecy.<a id="FNanchor_XI-19" href="#Footnote_XI-19" class="fnanchor">[XI-19]</a> Another
tradition states that a very handsome man passed through
the country and left the cross as a memento, and this
many of the padres readily believed, declaring this personage
to be none other than the wanderer St Thomas.<a id="FNanchor_XI-20" href="#Footnote_XI-20" class="fnanchor">[XI-20]</a>
The opinion that it was introduced by early Christians,
or old-world pagans, is, however, opposed by the argument
that other more practical features of their culture
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_469">469</a></span>
would have left their mark at the same time. The symbol
itself is so simple and suggestive of so many ideas
that it seems to me most reasonable to suppose that the
natives adopted it without foreign aid. At all events,
as the cross was in use both as a religious emblem and
an instrument of punishment long before the Christian
era, it is surely unnecessary to account for its presence
in America by theories invented for the occasion, or,
in fact, in any way to connect it with Christianity.
The most common signification attributed to the symbol
is fertility or generation. A piece of wood fastened
horizontally to an upright beam indicated the height of
the overflow of the Nile. If the flood reached this mark,
the crops flourished; should it fail to do so, famine was
the result; thus, we are told, in Egypt the cross came to
be worshipped as a symbol of life and generation, or
feared as an image of decay and death. By other peoples
and for other reasons it was closely connected with
phallic rites, of which I shall speak elsewhere, or was
connected with the worship of that great fertilizer and
life-giver, the sun. Among the Chinese the cross signifies
conception. The cross of Thor may possibly be
an exception, and refer merely to his hammer or thunderbolt.<a id="FNanchor_XI-21" href="#Footnote_XI-21" class="fnanchor">[XI-21]</a></p>

<p>With the Mexicans the cross was a symbol of rain,
the fertilizing element, or rather of the four winds, the
bearers of rain, and as such it was one of Quetzalcoatl's
emblems. Chalchiuitlicue, the sister of the rain-gods,
bore in her hands a cross-shaped vessel. The cross is to
be found in Mexican MSS., and appears in that of Fejérvary
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_470">470</a></span>
with a bird, which, as an inhabitant of the air,
may be said to accord with the character of the symbol.
The Mexican name of the cross, <i>tonacaquahuitl</i>, 'tree of
one life, or flesh,' certainly conveys the idea of fertility.
It is nevertheless regarded by some writers merely as an
astronomical sign.<a id="FNanchor_XI-22" href="#Footnote_XI-22" class="fnanchor">[XI-22]</a> The first cross noticed by the Spaniards
stood within the turreted court-yard of a temple
on Cozumel Island; it was composed of lime and stone,
and was ten spans (palmos) in height. To this cross the
natives prayed for rain, and in times of drought went in
procession to offer <i>vahomche</i>, as they called the symbol,
quails and other propitiatory gifts. Another cross stood
within the precincts of the Spanish cloister at Mérida,
whither the pious monks had most likely brought it from
Cozumel; it was about three feet high, six inches thick,
and had another cross sculptured on its face.<a id="FNanchor_XI-23" href="#Footnote_XI-23" class="fnanchor">[XI-23]</a> The
sculptured cross at Palenque has the latin form; a bird
is perched on its apex, and on either side stands a human
figure, apparently priests, one of whom offers it a child.<a id="FNanchor_XI-24" href="#Footnote_XI-24" class="fnanchor">[XI-24]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_471">471</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">HUMAN SACRIFICES IN YUCATAN.</p>

<p>The Yucatecs were as careful as the Mexicans to prepare
for their numerous festivals by fasts marked by
strict chastity and absence from salt and pepper.<a id="FNanchor_XI-25" href="#Footnote_XI-25" class="fnanchor">[XI-25]</a> Scarification
could not be omitted by the pious on these occasions,
although women were not called upon to draw
blood.<a id="FNanchor_XI-26" href="#Footnote_XI-26" class="fnanchor">[XI-26]</a> Yet their gods were not by any means so blood-thirsty
as the Mexican, being generally appeased by the
blood of animals, and human sacrifices were called for
only on extraordinary occasions. Cukulcan, like his
prototype Quetzalcoatl, doubtless opposed the shedding
of human blood, but after his departure the practice
certainly existed, and the pit at Chichen Itza, whose
waters he had consecrated with his person, was among
the first places to be polluted. The victims here were
generally young virgins, who were charged when they
should come into the presence of the gods to entreat them
for the needed blessings. Medel relates that on one occasion
the victim threatened to invoke the most terrible
evils upon the people, instead of blessings, if they sacrificed
her against her will; the perplexed priests
thought it prudent to let the girl go, and select another
and more tractable sacrifice in her place. The victims
who died under the knife, or were tied to a tree and
shot, were usually enslaved captives, especially those of
rank, but when these failed, criminals and even children
were substituted. All contributed to these sacrifices,
either by presenting slaves and children, or by subscribing
to the purchase money. While awaiting this doom
the victims were well treated, and conducted from town
to town amid great rejoicings; care was taken, however,
that no sinful act should detract from their purity or
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_472">472</a></span>
value.<a id="FNanchor_XI-27" href="#Footnote_XI-27" class="fnanchor">[XI-27]</a> Sometimes the body was eaten, says Landa,
the feet, hands and head being given to the priests, the
rest to the chiefs and others; but Cogolludo and Gomara
insist that cannibalism was not practiced. The latter
statement can not apply to the whole of the peninsula,
however, for on a preceding page Cogolludo relates that
Aguilar's shipwrecked companions were sacrificed and
eaten by the natives.<a id="FNanchor_XI-28" href="#Footnote_XI-28" class="fnanchor">[XI-28]</a></p>

<p>Confession, which Cukulcan is said to have introduced,
was much resorted to, the more so as death and disease
were thought to be direct punishments for sin committed.
Married priests were the regular confessors, but
these were not always applied to for spiritual aid; the
wife would often confess to her husband, or a husband
to his wife, or sometimes a public avowal was made. Mental
sins however, says Landa, were not confessed.<a id="FNanchor_XI-29" href="#Footnote_XI-29" class="fnanchor">[XI-29]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">PRIESTS OF YUCATAN.</p>

<p>The priesthood of Yucatan were divided into different
factions, some of which regarded Zamná and Cukulcan
as their respective founders, while others remained true
to more ancient leaders. According to Landa the high-priest
was termed Ahkin Mai, or Ahau Can Mai, and
held in great veneration, as one whose advice was followed
by the kings and grandees. The revenues of the
office, which passed as an inheritance to the son or nearest
relative, consisted of presents from the king and of
tributes collected by the priests. The ordinary priests
bore the title of <i>ahkin</i>,<a id="FNanchor_XI-30" href="#Footnote_XI-30" class="fnanchor">[XI-30]</a> and were divided into several
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_473">473</a></span>
classes. Some of them preached, made offerings, kept
records, and instructed the sons of nobles and those destined
for the priesthood in the various branches of education.
The <i>chilanes</i> who construed the oracles of the
gods, and accordingly exercised great influence, held the
highest place in the estimation of the people, before
whom they appeared in state, borne in litters. The sorcerers
and medicine men foretold fortunes and cured
diseases. The <i>chacs</i> were four old men elected at every
celebration to assist the priests, from which it would
seem that the priesthood was not a very numerous body.
<i>Nacon</i> was the title of the sacrificer, an office held
for life, but little esteemed; this title was also borne by
the general of the army, who assisted at certain festivals.
Marriage seems to have been permitted to all,
and confessors were actually required to have wives, yet
there were doubtless a large number who lived in a state
of celibacy, devoted to their sacred duties. Their dress
varied according to their rank, the high-priest being distinguished
by a mitre in addition to his peculiar robe;
the most usual dress was, however, a large white cotton
robe<a id="FNanchor_XI-31" href="#Footnote_XI-31" class="fnanchor">[XI-31]</a> and a turban formed by wreathing the unwashed
hair round the head, and keeping it pasted in that
position with blood. Connected with the sun worship
was an order of vestals, formed by princess Zuhui
Kak, 'fire virgin,' the daughter of Kinich Kakmo,
superioress of the vestals. The members were all volunteers,
who generally enrolled themselves for a certain
time, at the expiration of which they were allowed to
leave and enter the married state; some, however, remained
for ever in the service of the temple, and were
apotheosized. Their duty was to tend the sacred fire,
the emblem of the sun, and to keep strictly chaste;
those who broke their vows were shot to death with
arrows.<a id="FNanchor_XI-32" href="#Footnote_XI-32" class="fnanchor">[XI-32]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_474">474</a></span></p>

<p>The chief account of Guatemalan worship is derived
from the sacred book of the Quichés, the <i>Popol Vuh</i>, to
which I have already referred in the opening pages of
this volume, but the description given in it is so confused,
the names and attributes of the gods so mixed,
that no very reliable conclusions can be derived therefrom.
This very confusion seems, however, to indicate
that the imported names of Hurakan, Gucumatz, and
others, were with their attributes attached to native heroes,
who undergo the most varying fortunes and character,
amid which now and then a glance is obtained at
their original form.</p>

<p class="sidenote">TEPEU AND HURAKAN.</p>

<p>The most ancient of the gods are two persons called
Hun Ahpu Vuch and Hun Ahpu Utïu, or Xpiyacoc and
Xmucane, Creator and Protector, Grandfather and Grandmother
of the sun and moon, who are often confounded
under either gender and represented with big noses, like
tapirs, an animal sacred to these people. Brasseur identifies
them with the Mexican Oxomoco and Cipactonal,<a id="FNanchor_XI-33" href="#Footnote_XI-33" class="fnanchor">[XI-33]</a>
Tonacatlecutli and Tonacatepetl, Ometecutli and Omecihuatl,
the female also with Centeotl and Toci, and places
her in the Quiché calendar as Hun Ahpu, while the male
heads the list of months under the name of Imox.<a id="FNanchor_XI-34" href="#Footnote_XI-34" class="fnanchor">[XI-34]</a> Connected
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_475">475</a></span>
with them stands Tepeu, termed by the sacred
book Dominator, He who Begets, and whose name means
grand, majestic. Ximenez, by translating his name as
buboes, or syphilis, connects him with Nanahuatzin, the
Nahua hero who threw himself into the fire and rose as
the sun.<a id="FNanchor_XI-35" href="#Footnote_XI-35" class="fnanchor">[XI-35]</a> Tepeu is more generally known under the
name of Gucumatz, 'feathered snake,' which is universally
identified with Quetzalcoatl, the Nahua air god. In
this character he is said to transform himself every
seven days into four forms, snake, eagle, tiger, a mass
of coagulated blood, one after the other, and every
seven days he visits heaven and hell alternately. He
is also held to be the introducer of culture in Guatemala,
though more, as one who directs man in his search for
improvement, than as a culture-hero.<a id="FNanchor_XI-36" href="#Footnote_XI-36" class="fnanchor">[XI-36]</a> These two gods
blending into one, often form a trinity with Hun Ahpu
Vuch and Hun Ahpu Utïu, under the one name of Gucumatz,
the Heart of Heaven. The assumption by this
god of four forms may have reference to the divine quartette,
and in the expression "they are enveloped in a
mist of green and azure," Brasseur de Bourbourg sees a
reference to the sacred bundle containing the four first
men and sacrifices, transformed into gods.<a id="FNanchor_XI-37" href="#Footnote_XI-37" class="fnanchor">[XI-37]</a></p>

<p>Hurakan,<a id="FNanchor_XI-38" href="#Footnote_XI-38" class="fnanchor">[XI-38]</a> although connected with the above quartette
in the enumeration of titles of the supreme deity,
keeps aloof from the lower sphere in which these move
at times, and is even invoked by Gucumatz, who calls
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_476">476</a></span>
him, among other names, Creator, he who begets and
gives being. That he was held to be distinct, and worshiped
as such by the Quichés, may be seen from the
fact that they had one high-priest for Gucumatz, and another
for Tohil, another name of Hurakan, who seems to
have ranked a degree above the former.<a id="FNanchor_XI-39" href="#Footnote_XI-39" class="fnanchor">[XI-39]</a> He represented
the thunder and lightning, and his particular title
seems to have been Heart of Heaven, under which were
included the three phases of his attribute, the thunder,
the lightning, and the thunderbolt, or, as stated in another
place, the flash, the track of the lightning, and the
thunderbolt,<a id="FNanchor_XI-40" href="#Footnote_XI-40" class="fnanchor">[XI-40]</a> another conception of a trinity. He is
also called Centre of the Earth and is represented with
thunder in his hand. The bird Voc was his messenger.
Müller considers him a sun god, probably because of his
title 'Heart of Heaven,' which determines nothing,
while others hold him to be identical with the
Tlalocs, the Mexican rain gods. He is doubtless the
same as Tohil, the leader of the Quiché gods, who is
represented by the sign of water, but whose name signifies
rumble, clash.<a id="FNanchor_XI-41" href="#Footnote_XI-41" class="fnanchor">[XI-41]</a> In him are also found united the
three symbols of Quiché trinity, as will be seen shortly,
and his priests address him: "Hail, Beauty of the
Day, Hurakan, Heart of Heaven and of Earth! Thou
who givest glory, riches and children! Thou Tohil,
Avilix, Gagavitz, Bowels of Heaven, Bowels of Earth!
Thou who dost constitute the four ends of Heaven!"<a id="FNanchor_XI-42" href="#Footnote_XI-42" class="fnanchor">[XI-42]</a>
He was also god of fire, and as such gave his people fire
by shaking his sandals.<a id="FNanchor_XI-43" href="#Footnote_XI-43" class="fnanchor">[XI-43]</a> According to the version of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_477">477</a></span>
Brasseur de Bourbourg, his temple at Utatlan, where he
seems to have taken the place of an ancient god, was a
truncated pyramid with extremely steep steps in the façade.
On its summit was a temple of great height,
built of cut stone, and with a roof of precious woods; the
walls within and without were covered with fine, brilliant
stucco of extreme hardness. In the midst of the
most splendid surroundings sat the idol, on a throne set
with precious stones. His priests perpetually prayed and
burnt precious incense before him, relieving each other
in bands of thirteen, so that while some attended to his
service, the others fasted to prepare for it. The chief
men of the kingdom also attended in bands of eighteen,
to invoke his blessing for them and their provinces, nine
fasting, while nine offered incense.<a id="FNanchor_XI-44" href="#Footnote_XI-44" class="fnanchor">[XI-44]</a> Tohil, and the
other members of the trinity, Avilix and Hacavitz, or
Gagavitz, who also represent the thunder, the lightning,
and the thunderbolt, were the family gods given by the
Creator to the founders of the Quiché race, and though
they afterwards became stone, they could still assume
other shapes in conformity with the supreme will. As
family gods they had special temples in the palace of
the princes, where their regular service was conducted,
and three mountain peaks bearing their names, served to
keep them before the people.<a id="FNanchor_XI-45" href="#Footnote_XI-45" class="fnanchor">[XI-45]</a> The flint with which
Brinton identifies Tohil may, perhaps, be the black stone
brought from the far east, and venerated in the temple
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_478">478</a></span>
of Kahba, 'house of sacrifice,' at Utatlan, but there is
no confirmation by the chroniclers. It is, besides, stated
that the worship of Kahba had greatly declined, but
was again restored to something like its former glory by
Gucumatz; Tohil, on the other hand, always stood
high, and his high-priest belonged to a different family.<a id="FNanchor_XI-46" href="#Footnote_XI-46" class="fnanchor">[XI-46]</a>
A similar stone existed in a temple situated in a deep
ravine near Iximche, in whose polished face the gods
made known their will. This stone was often used to
determine the fate of those accused of crime; if the
judges perceived no change in the stone the prisoner
went free.<a id="FNanchor_XI-47" href="#Footnote_XI-47" class="fnanchor">[XI-47]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">HAVALITZ AND HACAVITZ.</p>
<p class="sidenote">ADVENTURES OF XQUIQ, HUN AHPU, AND XBALANQUE.</p>

<p>We now come to the heroes with whose adventures the
<i>Popol Vuh</i> is chiefly occupied. From the union of the
Grandfather and Grandmother who head the list of
Quiché deities, proceeded two sons, Hunhun Ahpu and
Vukab Hun Ahpu.<a id="FNanchor_XI-48" href="#Footnote_XI-48" class="fnanchor">[XI-48]</a> They incur the suspicion and
hatred of the princes of Xibalba, who plan their downfall
and for this purpose invite them to their court, under
the pretence of playing a game of ball with them. On
their arrival they are subjected to various indignities
and finally condemned to lose their heads. The head
of Hunhun Ahpu is placed between the withered
branches of a calabash-tree; but lo! a miracle takes
place; the tree immediately becomes laden with fruit
and the head turns into a calabash. Henceforth the tree
is held sacred and the king commands that none shall
touch it. Xquiq, however, a royal princess, Eve-like,
disregards the injunction, and approaches to pluck the
fruit. As she stretches forth her arm, Hunhun Ahpu
spits into her hand, and Xquiq finds herself pregnant.
Her father soon perceives her condition, and in a fury
condemns her to death, telling the executioners to bring
him the heart of his daughter to prove that they have
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_479">479</a></span>
done their duty. While being led to the wood Xquiq
pleads earnestly for her life, and finally prevails upon
her executioners to deceive her father by substituting for
her heart the jelly-like resin of a tree, which she procures.
Xquiq proceeds to Utatlan, to the Grandmother,
Xmucane, and gives birth to the twins Hun Ahpu and
Xbalanque,<a id="FNanchor_XI-49" href="#Footnote_XI-49" class="fnanchor">[XI-49]</a> who develop rapidly; their superior talents
soon make their elder brothers jealous, and they attempt
their destruction, but the twins anticipate their designs
and transform them into apes. These brothers Hun
Batz and Hun Chouen, were the sons of Hunhun Ahpu
by Xbakiyalo, and were invoked as the patrons of the
fine arts<a id="FNanchor_XI-50" href="#Footnote_XI-50" class="fnanchor">[XI-50]</a>. Brasseur de Bourbourg explains this myth by
saying that Hunhun Ahpu denotes the Nahua immigrants
who by their superiority gain the women of the
country, and whose children carry on a successful struggle
with the aboriginal race. The continuance of the
contest and the triumph of the Nahuas is described in
the adventures of Hun Ahpu and Xbalanque. A rat
reveals to them their origin, and the place where the
ball-game implements of their father are hidden. They
play a match with the Xibalba princes who had challenged
their father, and are successful in this as well as
several herculean tasks assigned to them, but are nevertheless
burned.<a id="FNanchor_XI-51" href="#Footnote_XI-51" class="fnanchor">[XI-51]</a> The ashes, thrown into the water, are
transformed into two handsome young men, and then
into man-fishes, a reference, perhaps, to the arrival by
sea of allies to help them. Again they make their appearance
in Xibalba, this time as conjurers, and lay
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_480">480</a></span>
their plans so skillfully as to overthrow the Prince Vukub
Cakix with his adherents, and obtain the apotheosis
of their father and his adherents as sun, moon,
and stars. Vukub Cakix, who represents the sun,
may be taken as the representative of an older
sun-worship replaced by the newer cult introduced by
Hun Ahpu.<a id="FNanchor_XI-52" href="#Footnote_XI-52" class="fnanchor">[XI-52]</a> The burning of this hero agrees with
that of the Mexican Nanahuatzin who by this act became
a sun. In fact, Brasseur de Bourbourg considers
the whole as a version of the Nahua myth. From another
point of view Hun Ahpu, whose name, signifying
'sarbacan-blower or air-shooter,' suits the attribute of
the air-god, may be considered as the morning wind
dispersing the clouds and disclosing the splendors of the
sun.<a id="FNanchor_XI-53" href="#Footnote_XI-53" class="fnanchor">[XI-53]</a></p>

<p>In the <i>Quatre Lettres</i>, the Abbé takes another view
of the myth, and sees in it but a version of the convulsions
that take place in the Antilles, the Seven Grottos
of the Mexican myth, of which I have spoken in
a preceding chapter. Hunhun Ahpu, Vukub Hun
Ahpu, and the two legitimate sons of the former are
volcanoes, and their plays, death, and transformation,
are earthquakes, extinction, and upheavals. The burning
of Hun Ahpu and Xbalanque and the scattering of
their ashes upon the waters is the final catastrophe, the
sinking of the Atlantides, or the seven islands; and as
the brothers rise again in the form of beautiful young
men, so do new islands take the place of those destroyed.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_481">481</a></span>
The confirmation of this he finds in a tradition
current on the islands, which speaks of certain upheavals
similar to the above.<a id="FNanchor_XI-54" href="#Footnote_XI-54" class="fnanchor">[XI-54]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">QUICHÉ GODS.</p>

<p>The Quichés had a multitude of other gods and genii,
who controlled the elements and exercised their influence
upon the destinies of man. The places where they most
loved to linger were dark quiet spots, in the undisturbed
silence of the grotto, at the foot of some steep
precipice, beneath the shade of mighty trees, especially
where a spring trickled forth between its roots, and on
the summit of the mountains; and here the simple native
came to pour out his sorrow, and to offer his sacrifice.
In some places this idea of seclusion was carried to such
an extent that idols were kept hidden in subterranean
chapels, that they might not be disturbed or the people
become too familiar with them; another reason, however,
was to prevent their being stolen by other villagers. The
god of the road had sanctuaries, called <i>mumah</i>, all along
the highways, especially at the junctions, and the traveler
in passing never failed to rub his legs with a handful
of grass, upon which he afterwards spat with great
respect, and deposited it upon the altar together with a
small stone, believing that this act of piety would give
him renewed strength. He also left a small tribute
from his stock of food or merchandise, which remained
to decay before the idol, for none dared to remove it.
This custom was also observed in Nicaragua.</p>

<p>The household gods were termed <i>chahalha</i>, 'guardian
of the house,' and to them incense was burned and sacrifice
made during the erection of a building; when
finished, a corner in the interior was consecrated to their
use. They seem to have been identified with the spirit
of departed friends, for occasionally a corpse was buried
beneath the house to insure their presence.<a id="FNanchor_XI-55" href="#Footnote_XI-55" class="fnanchor">[XI-55]</a></p>

<p>Among the more superstitious highlanders, the ancient
worship has retained its hold upon the population to a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_482">482</a></span>
great extent, in spite of the efforts of the padres. Scherzer
tells us that the people of Istlavacan reverenced gods
of reason, health, sowing, and others, under the names
of Noj, Ajmak, Kanil, and Ik, who were generally
embodied in natural features, as mountains, or big
trees. They recognized an Ormuzd and an Ahriman in
Kij, the god of light and good principle, opposed by
Juiup, the god of earth and evil principle, who was represented
by a rock, three feet high and one foot thick,
supposed to be a distorted human face. The native
priests generally took the horoscope, and appointed a
nagual, or guardian spirit for their children, before
the padres were allowed to baptize them. They are
said to have sacrificed infants, scattering their heart's
blood upon a stone before the idol, and burying the body
in the woods to avoid detection.<a id="FNanchor_XI-56" href="#Footnote_XI-56" class="fnanchor">[XI-56]</a></p>

<p>The Choles and Manches of Vera Paz, impressed with
the wild features of their country, venerated the mountains,
and on one called Escurruchan, which stood at the
junction of several branches of their principal river, they
kept up a perpetual fire to which passers-by added fuel,
and at which sacrifices were offered. At another place
the padres found a rough altar of stone and clay surrounded
by a fence, where they burned torches of black
wax and resinous wood, and offered fowls, and blood
from their bodies, to mountains, cross-roads and pools in
the river, whence came all means of existence and all
increase.<a id="FNanchor_XI-57" href="#Footnote_XI-57" class="fnanchor">[XI-57]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">WORSHIP OF A HORSE.</p>

<p>The chief idol of the Itzas was Hubo, who was
represented by a hollow metal figure with an opening
between the shoulders, through which human beings
were passed, charged to implore the favors of the gods.
A fire was then lighted beneath the figure, and while
the victims were roasting alive, their friends joined in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_483">483</a></span>
a dance around it, drowning the cries of the victims
with shouts and rattling of drums. No women were
allowed to join in the temple ceremonies. On the chief
island in the lake of Peten, the conquerors found twenty-one
stone temples with stone roofs, the chief of which
formed a kind of pyramid of nine steps. In this was
found a large chalchiuite, representing one of their two
battle-gods, Pakoc and Hunchunchan, who gave oracles
and were supposed to join the people in their dances.
This familiarity evidently bred contempt, however, for
it is related that when a prediction of the oracle was
not fulfilled, the priest without hesitation castigated
the idol. In the same temple stood a gypsum image
in the form of the sun, adorned with rays, inlaid with
nacar, and having a gaping mouth set with human
teeth. The bones of a horse, which hung from the
rafters, were adored as sacred relics. These were the
remains of a wounded horse left by Cortés among the
natives when on his way to Honduras. Having seen
the Spaniards fire from its back, they believed that
the animal produced the flash and report, and hence
adored it as Tziminchac, god of thunder, and brought
it flowers, flesh, and incense; but such offerings did
not sustain life, and it was not long before the bones
of the apotheosized charger were all that remained to
his worshipers. In another place was a stone and lime
imitation of this horse, seated on the floor on its haunches,
which the natives adored in the same manner. This
animal-worship was the more readily admitted, since
their gods was supposed to assume such forms.<a id="FNanchor_XI-58" href="#Footnote_XI-58" class="fnanchor">[XI-58]</a></p>

<p>Their idols were so numerous, say the conquerors,
that it took over a hundred men a whole day to destroy
those existing on the chief island alone; Cogolludo
affirms that the priests had charge of all the idols.<a id="FNanchor_XI-59" href="#Footnote_XI-59" class="fnanchor">[XI-59]</a> The
chief god of the Cakchiquels, Chamalcan, or Chimalacan,<a id="FNanchor_XI-60" href="#Footnote_XI-60" class="fnanchor">[XI-60]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_484">484</a></span>
had many of the attributes of Tohil, but took the
form of a bat, the symbol of the royal house of Zotzil.
Every seventh and thirteenth day of the month the
priests placed before him blood-stained thorns, fresh white
resin, bark and branches of pine, and a cat, the emblem
of night, which were burned in his honor.<a id="FNanchor_XI-61" href="#Footnote_XI-61" class="fnanchor">[XI-61]</a></p>

<p>The purest form of sun-worship appears among the
Lacandones, who adored the luminary without the
intervention of an image, and sacrificed before it in
the Mexican fashion. They had temples, however, the
walls of which were decorated with hieroglyphs of the
sun and moon, and with a figure in the act of praying
to the sun.<a id="FNanchor_XI-62" href="#Footnote_XI-62" class="fnanchor">[XI-62]</a> The Nahua tribe of the Pipiles also worshiped
the sun, before which they prostrated themselves
while offering incense and muttering invocations. Quetzalcoatl
and the goddess Itzqueye were honored in the
sacrifice,<a id="FNanchor_XI-63" href="#Footnote_XI-63" class="fnanchor">[XI-63]</a> which generally consisted of a deer. The
relative importance of Quetzalcoatl and Itzqueye, may
be seen from the statement that the festival held
in honor of the former on certain occasions lasted
fifteen days, while that in honor of the latter was but
of five days duration. The chief centre of worship
was at Mictlan, near Huixa Lake, where now is the
village of Santa Maria Mita, founded, according to tradition,
by an old man, who in company with an exceedingly
beautiful girl issued from the lake, both dressed
in long blue robes, the man also wearing a mitre.
He seated himself upon a stone on the hill, while the
girl pursued her way and disappeared, and here, by his
order, was built the temple of Mictlan, round which
stately palaces afterwards arose; he also organized the
government of the place.<a id="FNanchor_XI-64" href="#Footnote_XI-64" class="fnanchor">[XI-64]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_485">485</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">TRADITION OF COMIZAHUAL.</p>

<p>Among the vestiges of older worship we find the natives
of Cerquin in Honduras,<a id="FNanchor_XI-65" href="#Footnote_XI-65" class="fnanchor">[XI-65]</a> venerating and praying
for health to two idols, called respectively Great Father
and Great Mother, which probably refer to the Grandfather
and Grandmother of the Quichés. A faint idea
of a Supreme Being, says Torquemada, was mixed up
with the worship of the sun and stars, to which sacrifices
were made. Their culture-tradition speaks of a beautiful
white woman, called Comizahual, or 'flying tigress,'
a reputed sorceress, as the introducer of civilization in
Cerquin. She is said to have descended from heaven
and to have been transported by an invisible hand to
the city of Cealcoquin, where she built a palace adorned
with monstrous figures of men and animals, and placed
in the chief temple a stone having on each of its three
sides three faces of strange and hideous aspect; by aid
of this stone she conquered her enemies. She remained
a virgin, yet three sons were born to her,<a id="FNanchor_XI-66" href="#Footnote_XI-66" class="fnanchor">[XI-66]</a> among whom
she divided the kingdom when she grew old. After
arranging her affairs, she commanded her attendants to
carry her on her bed to the highest part of the palace,
whence she suddenly disappeared amid thunder and
lightning, doubtless to resume her place among the gods;
directly afterwards a beautiful bird was seen to fly upwards
and disappear. The people erected a temple in
her honor, where the priest delivered her oracles, and
celebrated every year the anniversary of her disappearance
with great feasts. Palacio refers to a stone, like
the one with three faces, named Icelaca, in Cezori, which
disclosed things past, present, and future, and before
which the people sacrificed fowls, rabbits and various
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_486">486</a></span>
kinds of food, and smeared the face with blood drawn
from the generative organs.<a id="FNanchor_XI-67" href="#Footnote_XI-67" class="fnanchor">[XI-67]</a></p>

<p>The religious fervor of the people is shown by the fact
that whatever work they undertook they commenced by
sanctifying it with prayers and offerings and by incensing
their implements that they might acquire more
efficacy; thus, before commencing to sow, the laborers
killed a turkey whose blood they scattered over the
field, and performed other ceremonies.<a id="FNanchor_XI-68" href="#Footnote_XI-68" class="fnanchor">[XI-68]</a> Simple in their
mode of life, they did not importune the gods for vain
luxuries: their prayers were for long life, health, children,
and the necessaries of life. The first they hoped
to obtain by scarifications and penances; to guard
against disease, they sent the priest a bird, generally a
quail, to sacrifice. When actually attacked by sickness
confession was resorted to as a powerful means of propitiation,
as was also the case on all important occasions
to secure divine blessings and avert immediate danger.
It is related by an old chronicler that when a party of
travelers met a jaguar or puma, each one immediately
commended himself to the gods and confessed in a loud
voice the sins he had committed, imploring pardon. If
the object of their terror still advanced upon them, they
cried, "we have committed as many more sins, do not
kill us!" and sat down, saying one to another, "one of
us has done some grievous deed, and him the wild beast
will kill!"<a id="FNanchor_XI-69" href="#Footnote_XI-69" class="fnanchor">[XI-69]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">SPECIAL FASTS.</p>

<p>In their scarifications, those who drew the most blood,
especially from the secret organs, were held to be the
most pious. Among the Pipiles the women joined in
drawing blood from the ears and tongue, and smearing
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_487">487</a></span>
it on cotton, offered it to Quetzalcoatl, and then to
Itzcueye.<a id="FNanchor_XI-70" href="#Footnote_XI-70" class="fnanchor">[XI-70]</a> On extraordinary occasions, as in the event
of a public calamity, the priests and chief men held a
council to determine the propitiatory penance to be imposed
on the people, and the kind of sacrifice to be
offered; the Ahgih were called upon to trace magic circles
and figures, and to cast grains, so as to determine the
time when it should be made. The esteemed task of
collecting the fuel for this celebration devolved upon a
royal prince, who formed the boys of the district into
bands to forage for the wood. The efforts of the people
alone were not considered sufficient at such times to
propitiate the gods; it required the sanctified presence
and powerful influence of the high priest to secure
remission of sins. This personage, whether king or
pontiff, subjected himself to a very severe fast and
penance during the twenty, or even hundred days determined
upon. He removed to an arbor near the hidden
sanctuary of the idols, and lived in entire solitude,
subsisting on grains and fruit, touching no food prepared
by fire, sacrificing the offerings brought him
during the day, and drawing blood. The fast over, with
its attendant separation of man and wife, bathing, painting
in red, and other acts of penance, the nobles went
in a body to the retreat of the idols, and having adorned
them in the most splendid manner, conducted them in
procession to the town, attended by the high priest and
victims. In places where the idols were kept in the
temples of the town, they marched with them round
the city. The various rites closed with games of ball,
played under the supervision of the idols, and with
feasting and reveling.<a id="FNanchor_XI-71" href="#Footnote_XI-71" class="fnanchor">[XI-71]</a></p>

<p>The Popol Vuh ascribes the introduction of human
sacrifices to Tohil, who exacted this offering from the
first four men in return for the fire given to the Quichés,
while Las Casas states that Xbalanque initiated
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_488">488</a></span>
them. Their knives of sacrifice, he says, had fallen
from heaven, and were accordingly adored as 'hands of
God,' and set in rich handles of gold or silver, ornamented
with turquoises and emeralds. The ordinary
sacrifices occurred several times a month, and among the
Pipiles, the number and quality were indicated by the
calendar and consisted chiefly of bastard boys from six
to twelve years of age. Their most solemn offerings
were made at the commencement and end of the rains,
and were attended by the chief men only. Juarros
states that human sacrifices were not offered by the
Pipiles and that the attempt of caciques to introduce them
resulted in an insurrection; and, although this will
scarcely apply to later times, it seems that formerly
the sacrifices were very few in number. The Cakchiquels
are, however, said to have abstained from the
rite. Cortés relates that at Acalá the fairest girls to
be found were selected by the priests and brought up,
in strict chastity, to be sacrificed, at the proper time, to
the goddess of the place. The Itzas, who, when captives
failed, took the fattest of their young men for victims,
had several modes of immolation, as roasting the victims
alive in the metal image; dispatching them with
the knife on the stone of sacrifice, a large one of which
was found at Taysal; impalement, followed by extraction
of the heart, as at Prospero; and in earlier times shooting,
as was done by their Yucatec ancestors. According
to Cogolludo, three persons assisted at the sacrifices,
the <i>adkulel</i>, master of ceremonies, the <i>adkayom</i>, and a
virgin who must be the daughter of one of these; but
Villagutierre mentions that the stone of sacrifice at the
chief temple at Taysal, was surrounded by twelve seats
for the attendant priests; and assistants to hold the victims
were certainly required. Cannibalism seems to
have attended all these sacrifices, the flesh being boiled
and seasoned, and the choice bits reserved for the high
priests and chiefs.<a id="FNanchor_XI-72" href="#Footnote_XI-72" class="fnanchor">[XI-72]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE PRIESTS OF GUATEMALA.</p>

<p>Each of the numerous tribes of Guatemala had a distinct
and separate body of priests, who by means of their
oracles exercised a decided influence on the state, and
some, the Quichés for instance, were spiritually governed
by independent pontiffs. The high priests of Tohil and
Gucumatz, Ahau Ah Tohil and Ahau Ah Gucumatz,
belonged to the royal house of Cawek, and held the fourth
and fifth rank respectively among the grandees of the
Empire; Ahau-Avilix, the high-priest of Avilix, was a
member of the Nihaïb family; Ahau Gagavitz came of
the Ahau Quiché house; and the two high-priests of the
Kahba temple in Utatlan were of the Zakik house, and
each had a province allotted him for his support. The
Tohil priests were vowed to perpetual continence and
austere penitence, and were not permitted to taste meat
or bread.<a id="FNanchor_XI-73" href="#Footnote_XI-73" class="fnanchor">[XI-73]</a> The pontiff at Mictlan, in Salvador, who stood
on nearly the same level as the king, bore the title of
Teoti, 'divine'<a id="FNanchor_XI-74" href="#Footnote_XI-74" class="fnanchor">[XI-74]</a> and was distinguished by a long blue
robe, a diadem, and a baton like an episcopal cross; on
solemn occasions he substituted a mitre of beautiful
feathers for the diadem. Next to him came an ecclesiastical
council composed of the Tehuamatlini, chief of the
astrologers and learned priests, who acted as lieutenant
of the high priest, and superintended the writings
and divinations, and four other priests, <i>teopixqui</i>, who
dressed in different colors. These ruled the rest of the
priesthood, composed of keepers of properties, sacrificers,
watchers, and the ordinary priests, termed <i>teupas</i>, who
were all appointed by the high-priests from the sons of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_490">490</a></span>
the ministers. When the high-priest died, the body
was embalmed and placed in a crypt beneath the palace.
After fifteen days of mourning, attended by fasts, the
king and Tehuamatlini drew lots for his successor from
among the four teopixqui, the vacancy in their ranks
being filled by a son of the pontiff, or one of their own
sons. The elected purified himself for the office by
blood-letting and other observances, while the people
celebrated his accession with feasting and dancing. In
Vera Paz the chief priest was elected according to merit
from a certain family by the people, and ranked next
to the king.<a id="FNanchor_XI-75" href="#Footnote_XI-75" class="fnanchor">[XI-75]</a> As an instance of the lasting influence
possessed by the priesthood over the people, Scherzer
relates that at Istlávacan there were a few years ago
as many as sixty priests, diviners, and medicine-men,
Ahgih, Ahqixb, and Ahqahb, as they used to be termed,
who exercised their offices among them. At Coban,
says Villagutierre, a priest was so highly respected that
the person who presumed to touch him was expected to
fall dead immediately.<a id="FNanchor_XI-76" href="#Footnote_XI-76" class="fnanchor">[XI-76]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">GODS OF THE NICARAGUANS.</p>

<p class="p2">The Nahua impress, noticeable in the languages and
customs of Nicaragua, is still more strongly marked in
the mythology of that country.<a id="FNanchor_XI-77" href="#Footnote_XI-77" class="fnanchor">[XI-77]</a> Instead of obliterating
the older forms of worship, however, as it seems to have
done in the northern part of Central America, it has
here and there passed by many of the distinct beliefs
held by different tribes, and blended with the chief element
of a system which is traced to the Muyscas in
South America. The inquiries instituted by a Spanish
friar among different classes of people in the Nagrando
district go to prove that Tamagostat<a id="FNanchor_XI-78" href="#Footnote_XI-78" class="fnanchor">[XI-78]</a> and Cipattonal,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_491">491</a></span>
male and female deities who inhabit the regions of the
rising sun, were the supreme beings. They created all
things, stars as well as mortals, and re-created what
had been destroyed by the flood, in which work they
were aided by Ecalchot, surnamed Huehue, 'the aged,'
and Ciagat 'the little.' In Tamagostat Müller at once
recognizes Fomagata, the ancient sun-god of the Muyscas,
who after his dethronement by a newer solar deity became
more particularly the fire-god of that people, but
retained more of his original preëminence in the
countries to which his worship spread, as in Nicaragua.
This view is supported by the statement that he inhabited
the heavens above, or rather the region of sunrise.
His consort Cipattonal, Müller, judging from
their relationship, holds to be the moon; her name seems
however, to be derived from a Mexican source, probably
from <i>xipalli</i>, 'dark blue color,' and <i>tonalli</i>, 'sun,'<a id="FNanchor_XI-79" href="#Footnote_XI-79" class="fnanchor">[XI-79]</a> which
may be construed as referring to the sun in its blue
element, or, as the fainter sun, to the moon. In either
case the connection of the two is perfectly legitimate.
Ecalchot, who is represented as a young man, yet is
surnamed 'the aged,' seems to be the same as the Mexican
Ehecatl, 'wind, air,' an element ever young, yet ever
old, and Ciagat may mean 'moisture;'<a id="FNanchor_XI-80" href="#Footnote_XI-80" class="fnanchor">[XI-80]</a> both forming with
the sun the fertilizing forces that create.<a id="FNanchor_XI-81" href="#Footnote_XI-81" class="fnanchor">[XI-81]</a> Oviedo gives
the names of these deities as Tamagostat or Tamagostad,
Zipattoval or Zipattonal, Calchithuehue, and Chicoziagat,<a id="FNanchor_XI-82" href="#Footnote_XI-82" class="fnanchor">[XI-82]</a>
'father.' He further names Chiquinaut and Hecat
as gods of the winds, which seems to be merely another
version of Chicoziagat and Ehecatl.<a id="FNanchor_XI-83" href="#Footnote_XI-83" class="fnanchor">[XI-83]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_492">492</a></span></p>

<p>The Guatemalan trinity reappears in the character of
Omeyateite and Omeyatezigoat<a id="FNanchor_XI-84" href="#Footnote_XI-84" class="fnanchor">[XI-84]</a>&mdash;easily recognizable
in the Mexican Ometecutli and Omecihuatl&mdash;and their
son Ruiatcot, the rain god,<a id="FNanchor_XI-85" href="#Footnote_XI-85" class="fnanchor">[XI-85]</a> who sends forth thunder,
lightning and rain. They are also supposed to live
where the sun rises, doubtless because that seems the
abode of bliss, and as fertilizing forces they are regarded
as creators, but not connected with the two before mentioned.
Quiateot was the most prominent, if not the
supreme, member of the trinity, for the other two, as
representing the thunder and lighting, the forerunners,
or parents, of the showers, do not seem to have been invoked
when rain was wanted, or to have participated in
the sacrifices of young boys and girls offered on such
occasions.<a id="FNanchor_XI-86" href="#Footnote_XI-86" class="fnanchor">[XI-86]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE GODDESS OF THE VOLCANO.</p>

<p>The Nicaraguans had other deities presiding over the
elements, seasons, and necessaries of life. Thus, Macat
and Toste, also written Mazat and Teotost,<a id="FNanchor_XI-87" href="#Footnote_XI-87" class="fnanchor">[XI-87]</a> the deer
and rabbit, were gods of the chase. When a deer was
killed, the hunter placed the head in a basket in his
house, and regarded it as the representation of the god.<a id="FNanchor_XI-88" href="#Footnote_XI-88" class="fnanchor">[XI-88]</a>
Mixcoa was the god invoked by the traders, and those
about to make purchases; Cacaguat was the patron of
cacao-culture; Miquetanteot, god of hades, was evidently
the same as Mictlantecutli of Mexico; there were, besides,
others whose names have been given to the days of the
month. In Martiari the chief deity was called Tipotani.
In Nicaragua proper, they adored Tomaoteot, 'the
great god,' whose son Teotbilche was sent down to mankind.
This looks like another Christ-myth, especially
when we read of attendant angels who had wings and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_493">493</a></span>
flew about in heaven. The names of the two chief
angels were Taraacazcati and Tamacaztobal.<a id="FNanchor_XI-89" href="#Footnote_XI-89" class="fnanchor">[XI-89]</a> The Dirans
revered in particular the goddess of the volcano
Masaya; for her they placed food on the brink of the
crater, into which they cast human beings, especially
when she manifested her anger by earthquakes. On
such occasions the chiefs and priests, who alone were
permitted to look into the seething abyss, went to the
summit and called upon the genius, who issued from the
lake of fire in the form of an old woman and instructed
them what to do. She is described as a naked, dark-skinned
hag, with hanging breasts, scanty hair, long,
sharp teeth, and sunken glaring eyeballs. The gods
were invested with all the peculiarities of humanity,
formed of flesh and blood, and lived on the food provided
for man, besides blood and incense. They also
appeared on earth dressed like the natives, but since the
death of the cacique Xostoval these visits ceased.<a id="FNanchor_XI-90" href="#Footnote_XI-90" class="fnanchor">[XI-90]</a> They
were personified by idols of stone, clay, or wood, called
<i>teobat</i>,<a id="FNanchor_XI-91" href="#Footnote_XI-91" class="fnanchor">[XI-91]</a> whose forms their forefathers had transmitted;
to them were brought offerings of food and other things,
which were taken in at the door of the temple by boys
serving there, for none except the consecrated were
allowed to enter the sanctuary.<a id="FNanchor_XI-92" href="#Footnote_XI-92" class="fnanchor">[XI-92]</a> To encourage the piety
that prompted these offerings, the priests never failed to
remind the people of the punishment inflicted on the inhabitants
of the ancient capital of Nagrando, who having
given themselves up to the pursuit of pleasure, and
neglected the gods, were one night swallowed up, not a
vestige of their city being left.<a id="FNanchor_XI-93" href="#Footnote_XI-93" class="fnanchor">[XI-93]</a> The most acceptable
offering was, of course, human blood. At certain times
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_494">494</a></span>
the favorite idol was set on a spear and planted in an
open place amid gorgeously adorned attendants holding
banners, and flowers. Here the priests gashed their
tongues, and other parts, smearing the face of the image
with the blood that flowed, while the devout approached
to whisper their desires into the ear of the idol. Songs,
dances, and games attended these ceremonies.</p>

<p>Before each temple was a conic or pyramidal mound
of adobe, called <i>tescuit</i>, or <i>tezarit</i>, ascended by an interior
staircase.<a id="FNanchor_XI-94" href="#Footnote_XI-94" class="fnanchor">[XI-94]</a> From its summit, upon which there was
room for about ten men to stand, the priest proclaimed
the nature of the approaching festival, and the kind of
sacrifice to be made, and here, upon a stone block, the
victims, generally captives and slaves, had their hearts
cut out, after which they were decapitated, the body to
be cut up and prepared for the grand banquets, while
the head, if that of a captive, was hung on a tree near the
temple, a particular tree being reserved for each tribe
from whom the victims were captured. The most prized
victims were young boys and girls, who were brought
up by the chiefs for the purpose and treated with great
care and respect wherever they went, for they were supposed
to become deified after death and to exercise great
influence over the affairs of life. Women, who were
held to be unworthy to perform any duty in connection
with the temples, were immolated outside the temple
ground of the large sanctuaries, and even their flesh was
unclean food for the high-priest, who accordingly ate
only of the flesh of males.<a id="FNanchor_XI-95" href="#Footnote_XI-95" class="fnanchor">[XI-95]</a></p>

<p>Fasts and baptismal rites, so prominent hitherto, do
not appear to have been practiced in Nicaragua. A
kind of sacrament was administered, however, by means
of maize sprinkled with blood drawn from the generative
organs, and confession was a recognized institution. The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_495">495</a></span>
confessor was chosen from among the most aged and
respected citizens; a calabash suspended from the neck
was his badge of office. He was required to be a man
of blameless life, unmarried, and not connected with the
temple. Those who wished to confess went to his
house, and there standing with humility before him unburdened
their conscience. The confessor was forbidden
to reveal any secret confided to him in his official
capacity, under pain of punishment. The penance he
imposed was generally some kind of labor to be performed
for the benefit of the temple. Boys did not
confess, but seem to have reserved the avowal of their
peccadillos for maturer age.<a id="FNanchor_XI-96" href="#Footnote_XI-96" class="fnanchor">[XI-96]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">PRIESTS OF NICARAGUA.</p>

<p>The office of high-priest was held by the caciques, who
each in his turn left home and occupation and removed
to the chief temple, there to remain for a year attending
to religious matters and praying for the people. At the
expiration of the term he received the honorable distinction
of having his nose perforated. Subordinate duties
were performed by boys. In the inferior temples other
classes entered for a year's penance, living like the chief
in strict seclusion, except at festivals perhaps, seeing
none but the boys who brought food from their homes.
The ordinary priests were called <i>tamagast</i><a id="FNanchor_XI-97" href="#Footnote_XI-97" class="fnanchor">[XI-97]</a> and lived
on the offerings made to the idols, and perhaps by their
own exertions, for the temples had no fixed revenues.<a id="FNanchor_XI-98" href="#Footnote_XI-98" class="fnanchor">[XI-98]</a>
They had sorcerers, <i>texoxes</i>, who sometimes caused the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_496">496</a></span>
death of children by merely looking at them, and who
could assume animal forms, for which reasons they were
much feared by the people. To strengthen this belief
they at times disguised themselves in skins of beasts.<a id="FNanchor_XI-99" href="#Footnote_XI-99" class="fnanchor">[XI-99]</a>
In Honduras the idea of a Supreme Being and Creator
was connected with a worship of the sun, moon, and
stars, to which the people made sacrifices.<a id="FNanchor_XI-100" href="#Footnote_XI-100" class="fnanchor">[XI-100]</a> Near
Truxillo were three chief temples<a id="FNanchor_XI-101" href="#Footnote_XI-101" class="fnanchor">[XI-101]</a> in one of which was
a chalchiuite in the form of a woman, to which the people
prayed, and which answered them through the priests.
Preparatory to any important undertaking, cocks, dogs,
or even men, were sacrificed to secure the favor of the
gods. In each of the sanctuaries presided a <i>papa</i>, or
chief priest, to whom the education of the sons of the
nobles was entrusted. These were unmarried men, distinguished
by long hair reaching to the waist, though in
some places they wound it round the head in plaits.
Their sanctity and superior knowledge gave them great
influence, and their advice was sought on all affairs of
importance by the principal men, for none else dared to
approach them. There were also sorcerers who could
assume animal forms, in which guise they went about
devouring men and spreading diseases.<a id="FNanchor_XI-102" href="#Footnote_XI-102" class="fnanchor">[XI-102]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE MOSQUITO PANTHEON.</p>

<p>Among the barbarians of the Mosquito Coast, we find,
of course, a much lower order of belief, and one which
calls to mind the ghouls and ghosts of Californian
mythology. The natives acknowledged a good spirit or
principle, to which they gave no definite name<a id="FNanchor_XI-103" href="#Footnote_XI-103" class="fnanchor">[XI-103]</a> and
rendered no homage, for there was no necessity, they
said, to pray to one who always did good; as for thanking
him for mercies received, such an idea seems never
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_497">497</a></span>
to have occurred to them. In fact, they had neither
temples nor idols, and the only ceremonies that partook
of a religious character were the conjurations of their
<i>sukias</i>, or sorceresses, who were constantly engaged in
breaking the spells of evil spirits, with which the people's
fancy, excited by grewsome stories told round the camp-fire,
had filled every dark and dismal place, every stream
and mountain top. These gnomes were known by the
name of Wulasha,<a id="FNanchor_XI-104" href="#Footnote_XI-104" class="fnanchor">[XI-104]</a> and were supposed to issue from
their hiding-places, especially at night, to do all manner
of evil; they were especially addicted to carrying off
solitary wanderers; it was, therefore, say the chroniclers,
almost impossible to induce a native to go out alone after
dark.</p>

<p>Amid the underwood and fallen trees about the
sources of rivers, big snakes were thought to dwell.
These monsters were assisted by a resistless upward current
and a strong wind which swept the unwary boatman
within the reach of the red jaws and slimy folds.
Patook, among other rivers, had this bad reputation,
and a white man who despite the warnings of the
natives started to explore its mysteries, returned in a
few days with the story that his progress had been opposed
by a big white cock. Leewa<a id="FNanchor_XI-105" href="#Footnote_XI-105" class="fnanchor">[XI-105]</a> was the name of
the water spirit, who sucked the bather into pools and
eddies and sent forth devastating waterspouts and hurricanes.
Wihwin, a spirit having the appearance of a
horse,<a id="FNanchor_XI-106" href="#Footnote_XI-106" class="fnanchor">[XI-106]</a> with tremendous teeth to devour human prey,
haunted the hills during the summer, but retired with
the winter to the sea, whence he originally issued. In
mountain caves, guarded by fierce white boars, lived the
patron deity of the <i>warrees</i>, the wild pigs of the country,
of childish form but immense strength, who directed the
movements of the droves. There were, besides, certain
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_498">498</a></span>
venomous lizards, who after biting a man ran immediately
to the nearest water: if the wounded person
did the same and succeeded in reaching the water first,
he was saved, and the lizard died; otherwise the man
was doomed.<a id="FNanchor_XI-107" href="#Footnote_XI-107" class="fnanchor">[XI-107]</a> The Sukias who were called upon to
exorcise these malignant beings on every occasion of
sickness, or misfortune, were generally old hags, supposed
to have a compact with the evil one, in whose name
they exacted half their fee before commencing their enchantments.
The Caribs held regular meetings or festivals
to propitiate these spirits, and the Woolwas, who
seem to have had many religious forms in common with
the Nicaraguans, had "dances with the gods."<a id="FNanchor_XI-108" href="#Footnote_XI-108" class="fnanchor">[XI-108]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">GODS OF THE ISTHMIANS.</p>

<p class="p2">Among the Isthmians several forms of worship appear,
that in the vicinity of Panamá resembling the system
prevalent in Hayti and Cuba, says Gomara.<a id="FNanchor_XI-109" href="#Footnote_XI-109" class="fnanchor">[XI-109]</a> The
heavenly bodies seem to have been very generally
adored, especially in the northern part of the Isthmus,
where all good things were thought to come from the sun
and moon, which were considered as man and wife; but
no accounts are given of temples, or forms of worship,
except that prayers were addressed to the sun.<a id="FNanchor_XI-110" href="#Footnote_XI-110" class="fnanchor">[XI-110]</a></p>

<p>The most prominent personage in the Isthmian pantheon
was Dabaiba, a goddess who controlled the thunder
and lightning, and with their aid devastated the lands
of those who displeased her. In South America, thunder
and lightning were held to be the instruments used by
the sun to inflict punishment upon its enemies, which
makes it probable that Dabaiba was a transformed sun-goddess.
Pilgrims resorted from afar to her temple at
Urabá, bringing costly presents and human victims, who
were first killed and then burned, that the savory odors
of roasting flesh might be grateful in the delicate nostrils
of the goddess. Some describe her as a native princess,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_499">499</a></span>
whose reign was marked by great wisdom and many miracles,
and who was apotheosized after death. She was also
honored as the mother of the Creator, the maker of the
sun, the moon, and all invisible things, and the sender
of blessings, who seems to have acted as mediator between
the people and his mother, for their prayers for
rain were addressed to him, although she is described as
controlling the showers, and once when her worship
was neglected she inflicted a severe drought upon the
country.</p>

<p>When the needs of the people were very urgent, the
chiefs and priests remained in the temple fasting and
praying with uplifted hands; the people meanwhile observed
a four-days fast, lacerating their bodies and washing
their faces, which were at other times covered with
paint. So strict was this fast that no meat or drink
was to be touched until the fourth day, and then only a
soup made from maize-flour. The priests themselves
were sworn to perpetual chastity and abstinence, and
those who went astray in these matters were burned or
stoned to death. Their temples were encompassed with
walls and kept scrupulously clean; golden trumpets, and
bells with bone clappers summoned the people to worship.<a id="FNanchor_XI-111" href="#Footnote_XI-111" class="fnanchor">[XI-111]</a></p>

<p>In the province of Pocorosa the existence of a rain-god
called Chipiripe was recognized, who inhabited the
heaven above, whence he regulated celestial movements;
with him lived a beautiful woman with one child.
Nothing else was known respecting this divine family.
This ignorance of the deity was further manifested by
the absence of any form of worship; the moral laws were
well defined, however, so that adultery and even lying
were regarded as sinful.<a id="FNanchor_XI-112" href="#Footnote_XI-112" class="fnanchor">[XI-112]</a> Las Casas states that Chicune,
'the beginning of all,' who lived in heaven,
was the one being to whom the people of Darien
addressed their invocations and sacrifices, though a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_500">500</a></span>
certain sect, or tribe, among them worshiped the water.
In another chapter he declares that the Isthmians
had little or no religion, for they had no temples
and few or no gods or idols.<a id="FNanchor_XI-113" href="#Footnote_XI-113" class="fnanchor">[XI-113]</a> According to Peter
Martyr, the embalmed and bejeweled bodies of ancestors
were worshiped in Comagre, and in Veragua gold
was invested with divine qualities, so that the gathering
of it was attended with fasting and penance.<a id="FNanchor_XI-114" href="#Footnote_XI-114" class="fnanchor">[XI-114]</a> Tuira,
whom the Spanish writers declared to have been the
devil himself, was a widely known being who communed
with his servants, <i>tequina</i>, 'masters,'<a id="FNanchor_XI-115" href="#Footnote_XI-115" class="fnanchor">[XI-115]</a> in roofless huts
kept for this purpose. Here the tequinas entered at
night, and spoke in different voices, to induce the
belief that the spirits were actually answering their questions;
the result of the interview was communicated to
their patrons. At times the evil one appeared in the
guise of a handsome boy without hands<a id="FNanchor_XI-116" href="#Footnote_XI-116" class="fnanchor">[XI-116]</a> and with
three-toed feet, and accompanied the sorcerers upon their
expeditions to work mischief, and supplied them with a
protecting ointment. Among the evil deeds imputed to
these sorcerers was that of sucking the navel of sleeping
people until they died.<a id="FNanchor_XI-117" href="#Footnote_XI-117" class="fnanchor">[XI-117]</a> These men naturally took
care to foster ideas that tended to sustain or increase their
influence, and circulated, besides, most extravagant stories
of supernatural events and beings. Once a terrible hurricane,
blowing from the east, devastated the country and
brought with it two birds with maiden faces, one of
which was of a size so great that it seized upon men and
carried them off to its mountain nest. No tree could
support it, and where it alighted upon the rocks, the
imprint of its talons were left. The other bird was
smaller and supposed to be the offspring of the first.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_501">501</a></span>
After trying several plans to kill these man-eating harpies,
they hit upon the device of fixing a large beam in
the ground, near the place where they usually alighted,
leaving only one end exposed, on which was carved the
image of a man. With the dawn of day the larger
bird came swooping down upon the decoy and imbedded
its claws so firmly in the beam that it could not withdraw
them, and thus the people were enabled to kill it.<a id="FNanchor_XI-118" href="#Footnote_XI-118" class="fnanchor">[XI-118]</a></p>

<p>The knowledge that the human mind, no matter
how low its condition, can be capable of such puerile
conceptions, must bring with it a sense of humiliation to
the thinking man; and well were it for him could he
comfort himself with the belief that such debasing superstitions
were at least confined to humanity in its first and
lowest stages; but this he cannot do. It is true that the
belief of the civilized Aztec was far higher and nobler
than that of the uncivilized Carib, but can he who has
read the evidence upon which old women and young
maidens were convicted of riding upon broomsticks to
witches' Sabbaths, by the most learned judges of the
most learned law-courts of modern Europe, deny that
the coarsest superstition and the highest civilization have
hitherto gone hand in hand.</p>

<p class="sidenote p2">PHALLIC WORSHIP.</p>

<p class="p2">Before leaving this division it will be well to say a
few words concerning the existence of Phallic Worship
in America.</p>

<p>One of the first problems of the primitive man is creation.
If analogies lead him to conceive it as allied to a
birth, and the joint result of some unknown male and
female energy, then the symbolization of this power is
liable to take the gross form of phallic worship. Thus
it is that among the earliest nations of which we possess
any knowledge, the life-giving and vivifying
principle of nature has been always symbolized by the
human organs of generation. The Lingham of India,
the Phallus of Greece, the Priapus of Rome, the Baal-Peor
of the Hebrew records, and the Peor-Apis of Egypt,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_502">502</a></span>
all have plainly the same significance. In most mythologies
the sun, the principle of fire, the moon, and the
earth, were connected with this belief; the sun and moon
as the celestial emblems of the generative and productive
powers of nature, fire and the earth as the terrestrial
emblems. These were the Father and the Mother, and
their most obvious symbols, as already stated, were the
phallus and wares, or the Skuas and yoni of Hindustan.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to multiply quotations respecting the
basal though often veiled idea of One, underlying the
polytheistic systems. The difficulty to the human mind
of considering anything in another than human aspect,
and our natural delight in analogies, leads, however, in
many cases to the consideration in certain aspects of this
deity as a duality or joint essence of the masculine and
the feminine. Take the learned Cory's summary of
ancient mythology: "It recognizes, as the primary elements
of all things, two independent principles, of the
nature of male and female; and these, in mystic union,
as the soul and body, constitute the Great Hermaphrodite
Deity, The One, the universe itself, consisting still
of the two separate elements of its composition, modified
though combined in one individual.... If we investigate
the Pantheons of the ancient nations, we shall find that
each, notwithstanding the variety of names, acknowledged
the same deities and the same system of Theology;
and, however humble any of the deities may appear,
each who has any claim to antiquity will be found ultimately,
if not immediately, resolvable into one or other
of the Primeval Principles, the Great God and Goddess
of the Gentiles."<a id="FNanchor_XI-119" href="#Footnote_XI-119" class="fnanchor">[XI-119]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_503">503</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">RATIONALE OF PHALLIC WORSHIP.</p>

<p>To the moral ideal of the present age, an ideal derived
from acquired habit, not from nature, phallic worship
will doubtless appear repulsive and indelicate in
the extreme. It was, nevertheless, the most natural form
of worship that the primitive man could adopt; for him
the symbol had no impure meaning, and was associated
with none of the disgusting excesses by means of which,
as he became more sophisticated, he converted his reverence
of Nature into a worship of Lust.</p>

<p>What could be more natural than that he should symbolize
the fecundating principle, the creative power, by
the immediate cause of reproduction, or as he doubtless
took it, of creation, the phallus. He recognized no
impurity or licentiousness in the moderate and regular
gratification of any natural appetite; nor did it seem to
him that the organs of one species of enjoyment were
naturally to be considered as subjects of shame and concealment
more than those of another. As Payne Knight
remarks of the ancient nations of the old world: "In
an age, therefore, when no prejudices of artificial decency
existed, what more just and natural image could
they find, by which to express their idea of the beneficent
power of the great Creator than that organ which
endowed them with the power of procreation, and made
them partakers, not only of the felicity of the Deity,
but of his great characteristic attribute, that of multiplying
his own image, communicating his blessings, and
extending them to the generations yet unborn." Nothing
natural was to them offensively obscene. When the
Egyptian matrons touched the phallus they did so with
the pure wish of obtaining offspring. The gold lingam
on the neck of the Hindoo wives was not an object
of shame to them.</p>

<p class="sidenote">RELICS OF PHALLIC WORSHIP.</p>

<p>That the worship of the reciprocal principles of nature
was recognized and practiced in America, there is in my
mind no doubt. The almost universal prevalence of sun-worship,
which is, as I have already intimated, closely
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_504">504</a></span>
connected with phallic rites, would alone go far to prove
this, but an account of certain material relics and well
known customs is still more satisfactory evidence.</p>

<p>In Yucatan, according to Stephens, "the ornaments
upon the external cornice of several large buildings
actually consisted of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>membra conjuncta in coitu</i></span>, too
plainly sculptured to be misunderstood. And, if this
were not sufficient testimony, more was found in the
isolated and scattered representations of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>membrum
virile</i></span>, so accurate that even the Indians recognised the
object, and invited the attention of Mr Catherwood to
the originals of some of his drawings as yet unpublished."</p>

<p>The sculptured pillars to be seen at Copan and other
ruins in Central America, which are acknowledged to
be connected with sun worship, are very similar to
the sculptured phallus-pillars of the East.<a id="FNanchor_XI-120" href="#Footnote_XI-120" class="fnanchor">[XI-120]</a> Mr Squier
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_505">505</a></span>
is of the opinion that they may be considered as such,
and the Abbé Brasseur takes the same view in making
the plain cylindrical pillar found in so many places
the representation of the volcano, the goddess of love,
and whence it issues as the symbol of new life.
On another page he terms the phallus the Crescent,
the land whence the Nahuas originated, and the continent
of America the body.<a id="FNanchor_XI-121" href="#Footnote_XI-121" class="fnanchor">[XI-121]</a> Some of the pillars
appear without ornament, as the <i>picote</i> at Uxmal, a
round stone of irregular form, which stood in front of
one of the ruins, but the worshipers of Priapus at
Thespia and other places were content with a rude stone
for an image in early times. In Mexico according to
Gama, the presiding god of spring, Xopancalehuey
Tlalloc, was often represented without a human body,
having instead a pilaster or square column, upon a
pedestal covered with various sculptured designs.<a id="FNanchor_XI-122" href="#Footnote_XI-122" class="fnanchor">[XI-122]</a> In
Pánuco images of the generative organs were kept in the
temples as objects of worship, and statues representing
men and women performing the sexual act in various
postures stood in the temple-courts.<a id="FNanchor_XI-123" href="#Footnote_XI-123" class="fnanchor">[XI-123]</a> Near Laguna de
Terminos, on the coast of Yucatan, Grijalva found images
of men committing acts of indescribable beastliness,
while close by lay the bodies of victims recently sacrificed
in their honor.<a id="FNanchor_XI-124" href="#Footnote_XI-124" class="fnanchor">[XI-124]</a> The united symbols of the sexual
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_506">506</a></span>
organs were publicly worshiped in Tlascala, and in the
month of Quecholli a grand festival was held in honor of
Xochiquetzal, Xochitecatl, and Tlazolteotl, goddesses of
sensual delights, when the prostitutes and young men
addicted to sodomy were allowed to solicit custom on the
public streets.<a id="FNanchor_XI-125" href="#Footnote_XI-125" class="fnanchor">[XI-125]</a> On Zapatero Island, around Lake
Nicaragua, and in Costa Rica, a number of idols have
been found of which the disproportionately large <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>membrum
generationis virile in erectione</i></span> was the most prominent
feature. Palacio relates that at Cezori, in Honduras,
the natives offered blood drawn from the organs of generation
and circumcised boys before an idol called Icelaca,
which was simply a round stone,<a id="FNanchor_XI-126" href="#Footnote_XI-126" class="fnanchor">[XI-126]</a> with two faces
and a number of eyes, and was supposed to know all
things, past, present, and future.<a id="FNanchor_XI-127" href="#Footnote_XI-127" class="fnanchor">[XI-127]</a> The frequent occurrence
of the cross, which has served in so many and
such widely separated parts of the earth as the symbol of
the life-giving, creative, and fertilizing principle in nature,
is, perhaps, one of the most striking evidences of
the former recognition of the reciprocal principles of
nature by the Americans; especially when we remember
that the Mexican name for the emblem, tonacaquahuitl,
signifies 'tree of one life, or flesh.'<a id="FNanchor_XI-128" href="#Footnote_XI-128" class="fnanchor">[XI-128]</a> Of two terra-cotta
relics found at Ococingo, in the state of Chiapas,
one would certainly attract the attention of any one who
had investigated the subject of phallic worship or had
seen the phallic amulets and ornaments of the old
world.<a id="FNanchor_XI-129" href="#Footnote_XI-129" class="fnanchor">[XI-129]</a> In the Museum at Mexico are two small
images which were evidently used as ornaments. Each
of these represents a human figure in a crouching posture,
clasping with both hands an enormous phallus.
Col. Brantz Mayer kindly showed me drawings of these
made by himself. One of these figures is reproduced in
another volume of this work.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_507">507</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">PHALLIC RITES.</p>

<p>The Pipiles abstained from their wives for four days
previous to sowing, in order to indulge in the marital
act to the fullest extent on the eve of that day, evidently
with a view to initiate or urge the fecundating powers of
nature. It is even said that certain persons were appointed
to perform the sexual act at the moment of
planting the first seed. During the bitter cold nights
of the Hyperborean winter, the Aleuts, both men and
women, joined hands in the open air and whirled perfectly
naked round certain idols, lighted only by the
pale moon. The spirit was supposed to hallow the dance
with his presence. There certainly could have been
no licentious element in this ceremony, for setting aside
the discomfort of dancing naked with the thermometer
at zero, we read that the dancers were blindfolded, and
that decorum was strictly enforced. In Nicaragua,
maize sprinkled with blood drawn from the genitals was
regarded as sacred food.<a id="FNanchor_XI-130" href="#Footnote_XI-130" class="fnanchor">[XI-130]</a> The custom of drawing blood
from this part of the body was observed as a religious
rite by almost every tribe from Mexico to Panamá,
though this, of course, does not prove that it was in all
cases connected with phallic worship. Circumcision is
regarded by Squier as a phallic rite, but there is not
sufficient testimony to support this view. Tezcatlipoca,
the chief god of the Nahuas, who has been frequently
identified with the sun, was adored as a love-god, according
to Boturini, who adds that the Nahua Lotharios held
disorderly festivals in his honor, to induce him to favor
their designs.<a id="FNanchor_XI-131" href="#Footnote_XI-131" class="fnanchor">[XI-131]</a> Orgies, characterized by the grossest
licentiousness are met with at different places along the
coast, as among the Nootkas, the Upper and Lower Californians,
in Sinaloa, Nicaragua, and especially in Yucatan,
where every festival ended in a debauch. During
a certain annual festival held in Nicaragua, women, of
whatever condition, could abandon themselves to the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_508">508</a></span>
embrace of whomever they pleased, without incurring
any disgrace.<a id="FNanchor_XI-132" href="#Footnote_XI-132" class="fnanchor">[XI-132]</a></p>

<p>The feast of the Mexican month Xocotlhuetzin, 'fall,
or maturity of fruit,' is to me a most striking evidence
of the former existence of phallic worship, or at least
recognition of the fecundating principle in nature. I
will, however, leave the reader to draw his own conclusions.
This feast of the 'maturity of fruit' was dedicated
to Xiuhtecutli, god of fire, and, therefore, of fertility,
or fecundity. The principal feature of the feast
was a tall, straight tree, which was stripped of all its
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_509">509</a></span>
branches except those close to the top and set up in the
court of the temple. Within a few feet of its top a cross-yard
thirty feet long was fastened; thus a perfect cross
was formed. Above all, a dough image of the god of
fire curiously dressed was fixed. After certain horrible
sacrifices had been made to the deity of the day, the
people assembled about the pole, and the youth scrambled
up for the image, which they broke in pieces and
scattered upon the ground.<a id="FNanchor_XI-133" href="#Footnote_XI-133" class="fnanchor">[XI-133]</a> A great number of similar
analogies may be detected in the rites and customs of
the people, and it is almost reluctantly that I refrain from
giving my views in full. I have made it my aim, however,
to deal with facts, and leave speculation to others.

<p>The hope, or at least the expectation of immortality, is
universal among men. The mind instinctively shrinks
from the thought of utter annihilation, and ever clings
to the hope of a future which shall be better than
the present. But as man's ideal of supreme happiness
depends upon his culture, tastes, and condition in this
life, we find among different people widely differing conceptions
of a future. The intellectual Greek looked forward
to the enjoyment of less gross and more varied
pleasures in his Elysian Fields, than the sensual Mussulman,
whose paradise was merely a place where bright-eyed
houris could administer to his every want, or the
fierce Viking whose Valhalla was a scene of continual
gluttony and strife, of alternate hewing in pieces and
swilling of mead.</p>

<p class="sidenote">IDEAS OF FUTURE.</p>

<p>It has been supposed by some that the idea of future
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_511">511</a></span>
punishment and reward was unknown to the Americans.<a id="FNanchor_XII-1" href="#Footnote_XII-1" class="fnanchor">[XII-1]</a>
This is certainly an error, for some of the Pacific Coast
tribes had very definite ideas of future retribution, and
almost all, in supposing that the manner of death influenced
the future state of the deceased, implied a belief
in future reward, at least. The slave, too, who was
sacrificed on the grave of his master, was thought to earn
by his devotion, enforced though it might be, a passport
to the realms of eternal joy; had there been no less
blissful bourne this prospective reward for fidelity would
have been manifestly superfluous.</p>

<p>The future life of these people was sharply defined,
and was of the earth, earthy. In its most common
forms it was merely earth-life, more or less free from
mortal ills. The soul was subject to the same wants as
the body, and must be supplied by the same means. In
fact, the pagan's conception of heaven was much more
clearly defined than the Christian's, and the former must
have anticipated a removal thither with a far less wondering
and troubled mind than the latter.</p>

<p>In the Mexican heaven there were various degrees of
happiness, and each was appointed to his place according
to his rank and deserts in this life. The high-born
warrior who fell gloriously in battle did not meet on
equal terms the base-born rustic who died in his bed.
Even in the House of the Sun, the most blissful abode of
the brave, the ordinary avocations of life were not entirely
dispensed with, and after their singing and dancing,
the man took up his bow again, and the woman her spindle.
The lower heavens possessed a less degree of splendor
and happiness until the abode of the great mass of
those who had lived an obscure life and died a natural
death was reached. These pursued their avocations
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_512">512</a></span>
by twilight, or passed their time in a dreamy condition,
or state of torpor. As slaves were often sacrificed over
their master's grave that they might serve in the next
world, we must suppose that differences of rank were
maintained there. The Tlascaltecs supposed that the
common people were after death transformed into beetles
and disgusting objects, while the nobler became stars
and beautiful birds. But this condition was also influenced
by the acts and conduct of friends of the deceased.</p>

<p>Sir John Lubbock<a id="FNanchor_XII-2" href="#Footnote_XII-2" class="fnanchor">[XII-2]</a> does not believe with Wilson and
other archæologists that the burial of implements with
the dead was because of any belief that they would be
of use to the deceased in a future state; but solely as a
tribute of affection, an outburst of that spirit of sacrifice
and offering so noticeable in all, from the most savage to
the most civilized, in the presence of lost brotherhood,
friendship, or love. In the first place the outfit in a
great majority of cases is wholly unfit and inadequate,
viewed in any rational scale of utility; they are not
such as the dead warrior would procure, if by any
means he were again restored to earth and to his friends.
In the second place it was and is usual to so effectually
mutilate the devoted arms and utensils, as to render
them a mere mockery if they are intended for the future
use of the dead. It is easy to classify this phenomenon
in the same category with the deserting or destroying of
the house of the deceased, the refusal to mention his
name, and all the other rude contrivances by which the
memory of their sorrow may be buried out of their sight.</p>

<p>This subject may be viewed in another light, however,
by considering that these Indians sometimes impute
spirits even to inanimate objects, and when the wife or
the slave is slain, their spirits meet the chief in the
future land. Do they not also break the bow and the
spear that the ghostly weapons may seek above the
hands of their sometime owner, not leaving him defenceless
among the awful shades. The mutilation of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_513">513</a></span>
the articles may perhaps be regarded as a symbolic killing,
to release the soul of the object; the inadequacy of
the supply may indicate that they were to be used only
during the journey, or preparatory state, more perfect
articles being given to the soul, or prepared by it, on
entering the heaven proper.</p>

<p>The slaves sacrificed at the grave by the Aztecs and
Tarascos were selected from various trades and professions
and took with them the most cherished articles of
the master, and the implements of their trade, wherewith
to supply his wants. Passports were given for the different
points along the road, and a dog as guide. Thus the
souls of animals are shown to have entered heaven with
man, and this is also implied by the belief that men
were there transformed into birds and insects, and that
they followed the chase. Another instance which seems
to indicate that the souls of these earthly objects were
used merely during the preparatory state, was the yearly
feast given to departed souls during the period that this
condition endured. After that they were left to oblivion.
The Miztecs had the custom of inviting the
spirits to enter and partake of the repast spread for them,
and this food, the essence of which had been consumed
by the unseen visitors, was regarded as sacred.<a id="FNanchor_XII-3" href="#Footnote_XII-3" class="fnanchor">[XII-3]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE ROAD TO HEAVEN.</p>

<p>The road to paradise was represented to be full of
dangers&mdash;an idea probably suggested to them by the
awful mystery of death. In the idea of this perilous
journey, this road beset with many dangers&mdash;storms,
monsters, deep waters, and whirlpools&mdash;we may trace a
belief in future retribution, for though the majority of
travelers manage to reach their destination having
only suffered more or less maltreatment by the way,
yet many a solitary, ill-provided wanderer is overwhelmed
and prevented from doing so. In exceptional
cases, the perils of this valley of the shadow of death
are avoided by the intervention of a friendly deity who,
Hermes-like, bears the weary soul straight to its rest.
Among the Mexicans Teoyaomique, the consort of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_514">514</a></span>
war-god, performed this good office for the fallen warrior.</p>

<p>With the alternative of this not very attractive future
before them, it is natural that the theory of metempsychosis
should have found wide and ready acceptance, for
with these people it did not mean purification from sin,
as among the Brahmans; it was simply the return of the
soul to the world, to live once more the old life, although
at times in a different and superior sphere. The human
form was, therefore, assumed more often than that of
animals. The soul generally entered the body of a
female relative to form the soul of the unborn infant; the
likeness of the child to a deceased friend in features or
peculiarities lent great weight to this belief. This reëmbodiment
was not limited to individuals; the Nootkas,
for instance, accounted for the existence of a distant
tribe, speaking the same language as themselves, by
declaring them to be the incarnated spirits of their dead.
The preservation of the bones of the dead, seems in some
cases to be connected with a belief in a resurrection of
the body. The opinion underlying the various customs
of preservation of remains, says Brinton, "was, that a
part of the soul, or one of the souls, dwelt in the bones;
that these were the seeds which, planted in the earth,
or preserved unbroken in safe places, would, in time,
put on once again a garb of flesh, and germinate into
living human beings."<a id="FNanchor_XII-4" href="#Footnote_XII-4" class="fnanchor">[XII-4]</a> Indeed, a Mexican creation-myth
relates that man sprang from dead bones,<a id="FNanchor_XII-5" href="#Footnote_XII-5" class="fnanchor">[XII-5]</a> and in
Goatzacoalco the bones were actually deposited in a convenient
place, that the soul might resume them.</p>

<p class="sidenote">IDEAS OF SOUL.</p>

<p>The most general idea of a soul seems to have been
that of a double self, possessing all the essence and attributes
of the individual, except the carnal embodiment,
and independent of the body in so far as it was able to
leave it, and revel in other scenes or spheres. It would
accordingly appear to another person, by day or night, as
a phantom, with recognizable form and features, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_515">515</a></span>
leave the impression of its visits in ideas, remembrances,
or dreams. Every misty outline, every rustle, was liable
to be regarded by the undiscriminating aborigine as a
soul on its wanderings, and the ideas of air, wind, breath,
shadow, soul, were often represented by the same word.
The Eskimo word <i>silla</i>, signifies air, wind, and conveys
the idea of world, mind; <i>tarnak</i>, means soul, shadow.
The Yakima word for wind and life contains the same
root; the Aztec <i>ehecatl</i> signifies wind, air, life, soul,
shadow; in Quiché the soul bears the name of <i>natub</i>,
shadow; the Nicaraguans think that it is <i>yulia</i>, the
breath, which goes to heaven.<a id="FNanchor_XII-6" href="#Footnote_XII-6" class="fnanchor">[XII-6]</a> Some hold that man
has several souls, one of which goes to heaven,
the others remain with the body, and hover about
their former home. The Mexicans and Quichés received
a soul after death from a stone placed between
the lips for that purpose, which also served for heart,
the seat of the soul;<a id="FNanchor_XII-7" href="#Footnote_XII-7" class="fnanchor">[XII-7]</a> this was buried with the remains.
The custom of eating the flesh of brave enemies
in order to inherit their virtues, points to a belief
in the existence of another soul or vital quality in the
corpse. Some Oregon tribes gave a soul to every member
of the body. A plurality of souls is also implied by
the belief in soul-wandering during sleep, for is not the
body animate though the soul be separated from it? Yet
the soul proper could not remain away from the body
beyond a certain time, lest the weaker soul that remained
should fail to sustain life.</p>

<p>With the many contradictions and vague statements
before us, it must be admitted that the phrase "immortality
of the soul" is often misleading. Tylor even considers
it doubtful "how far the lower psychology entertains
at all an absolute conception of immortality, for past
and future fade soon into utter vagueness as the savage
mind quits the present to explore them."<a id="FNanchor_XII-8" href="#Footnote_XII-8" class="fnanchor">[XII-8]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_516">516</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">METEMPSYCHOSIS.</p>

<p>Some tribes among the Hyperboreans actually disbelieved
in a future existence, while others held the
doctrine of a future reward and punishment. The conceptions
of a soul were well defined however; the Thlinkeets
supposed it to enter the spirit-world, among the
yeks, on being released from the body. The braves who
had fallen in battle, or had been murdered, became <i>keeyeks</i>,
'upper ones,' and went to dwell in the north, where
the aurora borealis, omen of war, flashes in reflection from
the lights which illuminate their dances; so at least the
Eskimos regard it.<a id="FNanchor_XII-9" href="#Footnote_XII-9" class="fnanchor">[XII-9]</a> Those who died a natural death
became <i>tákeeyeks</i>, land-spirits, and <i>tékeeyeks</i>, sea-spirits,
and dwelt in <i>takankon</i>, doubtless situated in the centre
of the earth,<a id="FNanchor_XII-10" href="#Footnote_XII-10" class="fnanchor">[XII-10]</a> the road to which was watered, and made
smooth by the tears of relatives, but if too much crying
was indulged in, it became swampy and difficult to travel.
The tákeeyeks and tékeeyeks appear to have attached
themselves as guardian spirits to the living, and were
under the control of the shamáns, before whom they
came in the form of land and sea animals, to do their
bidding and reveal the past and future.<a id="FNanchor_XII-11" href="#Footnote_XII-11" class="fnanchor">[XII-11]</a> The keeyeks
were evidently above the conjuration of the sorcerers.
The comforts of heaven, like the road to it, depended on
earthly conditions; thus, the body was burned in order
that it might be warm in its new home. Slaves, however,
who were buried, were condemned to freeze, but
the shamáns whose bodies were also left to moulder, had
doubtless power to avoid such misery. All lived in
heaven as on earth, earning their living in the same
manner, to which end the implements and other articles
burnt with them were brought into use; wealthy people
appointed two slaves to be sacrificed at the pyre, upon
whom devolved the duty of attending to their wants.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_517">517</a></span>
The slaves carried their long-pending doom very philosophically,
it is said.<a id="FNanchor_XII-12" href="#Footnote_XII-12" class="fnanchor">[XII-12]</a> It appears, however, that the
soul had the option of returning to this life, and as I
have said, generally entered the body of a female relative
to form the soul of a coming infant. If the child resembled
a deceased friend or relation, this reëmbodiment was at
once recognized, and the name of the dead person was
given to it. Metempsychosis does not appear to have
been restricted to relatives only, for the Thlinkeets were
often heard to express a desire to be born again into families
distinguished for wealth and position, and even to
wish to die soon in order to attain this bliss the earlier.<a id="FNanchor_XII-13" href="#Footnote_XII-13" class="fnanchor">[XII-13]</a>
This belief in the transmigration of souls was widely
spread, and accounts to some extent for the fearlessness
with which the Hyperboreans contemplated death.<a id="FNanchor_XII-14" href="#Footnote_XII-14" class="fnanchor">[XII-14]</a>
The Tacullies and Sicannis asked the deceased whether
he would return to life or not, and the shamán who put
the question decided the matter by looking at the naked
breast of the body through his fingers; he then raised
his hand toward heaven, and blew the soul, which had
apparently entered his fingers, into the air, that it might
seek a body to take possession of; or the shamán placed
his hands upon the head of one of the mourners and
sent the spirit into him, to be embodied in his next offspring.
The relative thus favored added the name of
the deceased to his own. If these things were not done
the deceased was supposed to depart to the centre of the
earth to enjoy happiness, according to their estimate of it.
The Kenai supposed that a soft twilight reigned perpetually
in this place, and that its inhabitants pursued
their avocations; while the living slept they worked.
The soul did not, however, attain perfect rest until a
feast had been given in its honor, attended by a distribution
of skins.<a id="FNanchor_XII-15" href="#Footnote_XII-15" class="fnanchor">[XII-15]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_518">518</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">FUTURE OF THE COLUMBIAN TRIBES.</p>

<p>Dall, in speaking of the Tinnehs, to which family the
Tacullies and Kenai belong, states that he found few who
believed in the immortality of the soul, and none in
future reward and punishment; any contrary assertion
he characterizes as proceeding from ignorance or exaggeration.
Other authors, however, in treating of tribes
situated both in the extreme north, and in the center of
this family, as the Loucheux and Chepewyans, declare
that good and wicked were treated according to their
deserts, the poor and rich often changing lots in the
other life. Terrible punishment was sometimes inflicted
upon the wicked in this world; thus, in Stickeen River
stand several stone pillars, which are said to be the remains
of an evil-doing chief and his family, whom divine
anger placed there as a warning to others. According
to Kennicott, the soul, whether good or bad, was received
by Chutsain, the spirit of death, who was, for this
reason probably, called the bad spirit.<a id="FNanchor_XII-16" href="#Footnote_XII-16" class="fnanchor">[XII-16]</a> The Eskimos
seem to have believed in a future state, for Richardson
relates that a dying man whom he saw at Cumberland
Inlet declared his joy at the prospect of meeting his
children in the other world and there living in bliss. It
is also a suggestive fact that implements and clothes
were buried with the body, care being taken that nothing
should press heavily upon it. The large destruction
of property practiced by some Rocky Mountain tribes
was for the purpose of obliterating the memory of the
deceased.<a id="FNanchor_XII-17" href="#Footnote_XII-17" class="fnanchor">[XII-17]</a> The Aleuts believed that the spirits of their
relatives attended them as good genii, and invoked them
on all trying occasions, especially in cases of <i>vendetta</i>.<a id="FNanchor_XII-18" href="#Footnote_XII-18" class="fnanchor">[XII-18]</a>
The Chepewyan story relates that the soul arrives after
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_519">519</a></span>
death at a river upon which floats a stone canoe. In
this it embarks and is borne by the gentle current to an
extensive lake in the midst of which is an enchanted
island. While the soul is drifting toward it, the actions
of its life are examined, and if the good predominate, the
canoe lands it on the shore, where the senses revel in
never-ending pleasures. But if the evil of its past life
out-weigh the good, the stone canoe sinks, leaving the
spirit-occupant immersed up to the chin, there eternally
to float and struggle, ever beholding but never realizing
the happiness of the good.<a id="FNanchor_XII-19" href="#Footnote_XII-19" class="fnanchor">[XII-19]</a> This pronounced belief in a
future reward and punishment obtained among several
of the Columbian tribes. The natives of Millbank
Sound picture it as two rivers guarded by huge gates,
and flowing out of a dark lake&mdash;the gloom of death.
The good enter the stream to the right, which sparkles
in constant sunshine, and supplies them with an abundance
of salmon and berries; the wicked pass in to the
left and suffer cold and starvation on its bleak, snow-clad
banks.<a id="FNanchor_XII-20" href="#Footnote_XII-20" class="fnanchor">[XII-20]</a> The Okanagans call paradise, or the
abode of the good spirit, <i>elemehumkillanwaist</i>, and hell,
where those who kill and steal go, <i>kishtsamah</i>. The
torments of the latter place are increased by an evil
spirit in human form, but with tail and ears like a horse,
who jumps about from tree to tree with a stick in his
hand and belabors the condemned.<a id="FNanchor_XII-21" href="#Footnote_XII-21" class="fnanchor">[XII-21]</a></p>

<p>Some among the Salish and Chinooks describe the
happy state as a bright land, called <i>tamath</i> by the latter,
evidently situated in the direction of the sunny south,
and abounding in all good things. Here the soul can
revel in enjoyments, which, however, depend on its
own exertions; the wealthy, therefore, take slaves with
them to perform the menial duties. The wicked on the
other hand are consigned to a desolate region under the
control of an evil spirit, known as the Black Chief, there
to be constantly tantalized by the sight of game, water
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_520">520</a></span>
and fire, which they can never reach. Some held that
tamath was gained by a difficult road called <i>otuihuti</i>,
which lay along the Milky Way, while others believed
that a canoe took the soul across the water that was supposed
to separate it from the land of the living.<a id="FNanchor_XII-22" href="#Footnote_XII-22" class="fnanchor">[XII-22]</a></p>

<p>The Nez Percés, Flatheads, and some of the Haidah
tribes believed that the wicked, after expiating their
crimes by a longer or shorter sojourn in the land of desolation,
were admitted to the abode of bliss. The Haidahs
called the latter place <i>keewuck</i>, 'above,' within
which seems to have been a still brighter spot termed
<i>keewuckkow</i>, 'life above,' the abode of perennial youth,
whither the spirit of the fallen brave took its flight.
Those who died a natural death were consigned with
the wicked to <i>seewukkow</i>, the purgatorial department,
situated in the forest, there to be purified before entering
the happy keewuck.<a id="FNanchor_XII-23" href="#Footnote_XII-23" class="fnanchor">[XII-23]</a> The Queen Charlotte Islanders
termed paradise 'the happy hunting-ground,' a
rather strange idea when we consider that their almost
sole avocation was fishing.<a id="FNanchor_XII-24" href="#Footnote_XII-24" class="fnanchor">[XII-24]</a> The Nez Percés believed
also in a purgatory for the living, and that the beavers
were men condemned to atone their sins before they
could resume the human form.<a id="FNanchor_XII-25" href="#Footnote_XII-25" class="fnanchor">[XII-25]</a> It seems to have been
undecided whether the wives and young children shared
the fate of the head of the family; the Flatheads expressed
a belief in reunion, but that may have been after
one or all had been purified in the intermediate state.
Those who sacrificed slaves on the grave, sent them
alike with the master that died gloriously on the battle-field,
or obscurely in his bed.</p>

<p class="sidenote">QUAWTEAHT AND CHAYHER.</p>

<p>The Ahts hold that the soul inhabits at once the heart
and the head of man. Some say that after death it will
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_521">521</a></span>
return to the animal form from which its owner can trace
his descent; others that, according to rank, disembodied
souls will go to live with Quawteaht or with Chayher.
Quawteaht inhabits a beautiful country somewhere up
in the heavens, though not directly over the earth; a
goodly land flowing with all manner of Indian milk and
honey; no storms there, no snow nor frost to bind the
rivers, but only warmth and sunshine and abundant
game and fish. Here the chiefs live in the very mansion
of Quawteaht, and the slain in battle live in
a neighboring lodge, enjoying also in their degree, all
the amenities of the place. And these are the only
doors to this Valhalla of the Ahts; only lofty birth or a
glorious death in battle can confer the right of entry
here. The souls of those that die a woman's death, in
their bed, go down to the land of Chayher. Chayher
is a figure of flesh without bones&mdash;thus reversing our
pictorial idea of the grisly king of terrors&mdash;who is in the
form of an old gray-bearded man. He wanders about
in the night stealing men's souls, when, unless the doctors
can recover the soul, the man dies. The country of
Chayher is also called chayher. It resembles a subterranean
earth but is every way an inferior country:
there are no salmon there and the deer are wretchedly
small, while the blankets are so thin and narrow as to
be almost useless for either warmth or decoration. This
is why people burn blankets when burying their friends;
they cannot bear that their friend be sent shivering to
the world below. The dead Aht seems to have been
allowed in some cases to roam about on earth in the
form of a person or animal, doing both good and evil, a
belief which induced many to make conciliatory offerings
of food to the deceased. Some Chinook tribes were
afraid to pronounce the names of their dead lest they
should be attracted and carry off souls. This was especially
feared at the sick-bed, and the medicine-man
had to be constantly on guard with his familiars to frustrate
such attempts.<a id="FNanchor_XII-26" href="#Footnote_XII-26" class="fnanchor">[XII-26]</a> The Aht sorcerer even sent his
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_522">522</a></span>
own soul down to chayher to recover the truant, in
which he generally succeeded, unless the spirit of the
sick man had entered a house.<a id="FNanchor_XII-27" href="#Footnote_XII-27" class="fnanchor">[XII-27]</a> Some among the tribes
believed that the soul issued from animals, especially sea-gulls
and partridges, and would return to its original
form. The Songhies said the hunter was transformed
into a deer, the fisherman into a fish; and the Nootkas,
that the spirit could reassume a human form if the celestial
abode were not to its taste.<a id="FNanchor_XII-28" href="#Footnote_XII-28" class="fnanchor">[XII-28]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">FUTURE OF THE CALIFORNIANS.</p>

<p>In striking contrast to the preceding beliefs in futurity,
and to that of the Clallams, who with universalistic
feeling believe that the good spirit will receive all,
without exception, in his happy hunting-ground, we are
told that the Pend d'Oreilles had no conceptions whatever
of soul or immortality, so that the missionaries found
it difficult to explain these matters to them. It is certainly
strange that a tribe surrounded by and in constant
contact with others who held these ideas should
have remained uninfluenced by them, especially as they
were extremely superstitious and believed in guardian
spirits and dreams.<a id="FNanchor_XII-29" href="#Footnote_XII-29" class="fnanchor">[XII-29]</a> Disbelief in a future state is
assigned to many tribes, which upon closer examination
are shown to possess ideas of a life after this;
such statements must, therefore, be accepted with caution.
Among the Californians who are said to identify
death with annihilation, are the Meewocs and the
tribes of the Sacramento Valley, yet the latter are afraid
to pronounce the name of a deceased person, lest he

Northern Californian regarded it as a great camping-ground,
under the charge of the good spirit, where all
meet after death, to enjoy a life free from want. But
there were dangers upon the road which led to this bliss;
for Omahá, the evil spirit, hovered near the dying man,
ready to snatch and carry off the soul as soon as it should
leave its earthly tenement. To prevent such a calamity,
the friends who attended the burning of the body
shouted and gesticulated to distract the Evil One's attention
and enable the heart, in which the soul resided, to
leap out of the flames and escape to heaven. If the
body was interred, they thought the devil would have
more chance of capturing the heart, which would then be
sent back to earth to annoy the living.<a id="FNanchor_XII-31" href="#Footnote_XII-31" class="fnanchor">[XII-31]</a> The natives
near the mouth of Russian River burned their dead to
prevent their becoming grizzlies, while those about Clear
Lake supposed that the wicked alone were thus metamorphosed,
or condemned to wander as spirits.<a id="FNanchor_XII-32" href="#Footnote_XII-32" class="fnanchor">[XII-32]</a> Others,
however, who adhered to interment, sought to complete
the ceremony before night, when the coyote, in which
form the evil spirit probably appeared, begins to howl,
and for three days they kept up noisy demonstrations
and fires at the graves; after that the fate of the soul
was no longer doubtful. If captured, the good spirit
could redeem it with a big knife. It was the belief in
some parts that the deceased remained in the grave during
the three days, and then proceeded to heaven, where
earth and sky meet, to become stars, chiefs assuming the
most brilliant forms.<a id="FNanchor_XII-33" href="#Footnote_XII-33" class="fnanchor">[XII-33]</a></p>

<p>The bright rivers, sunny slopes, and green forests of
the Euroc paradise are separated from the earth by a
deep chasm, which good and wicked alike must cross on
a thin, slippery pole. The former soon reach the goal,
aided, doubtless, by the good spirit, as well as by the fire
lighted on the grave by mourning friends, but the wicked
man has to falter unaided along the shivering bridge;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_524">524</a></span>
and many are the nights that pass before his friends
venture to dispense with the beacon, lest the soul miss
the path, and fall into the dark abyss. Nor does retribution
end with the peril and anxiety of the passage,
for many are liable to return to the earth as birds, beasts,
and insects. When a Kailta dies, a little bird carries
the soul to spirit-land, but its flight is impeded by the
sins of the wicked, which enables a watching hawk to
overtake and devour the soul.<a id="FNanchor_XII-34" href="#Footnote_XII-34" class="fnanchor">[XII-34]</a></p>

<p>The Cahrocs have a more distinct conception of future
reward and punishment, and suppose that the spirit on
its journey comes to two roads, one strewn with flowers
and leading to the bright western land beyond the great
waters, across which good Chareya doubtless aids it;
the other, bristling with thorns and briars, leading
to a place full of deadly serpents, where the wicked
must wander for ever.<a id="FNanchor_XII-35" href="#Footnote_XII-35" class="fnanchor">[XII-35]</a> The Tolewahs place heaven
behind the sun, wherever that is, and picture hell as a
dark place where souls shiver for ever before the cold
winds, and are harassed by fiends.<a id="FNanchor_XII-36" href="#Footnote_XII-36" class="fnanchor">[XII-36]</a> The Modocs believe
in a spirit-land, evidently situated in the air above
the earthly home, where souls hover about inciting the
living to good or evil. Merit appears to be measured
by bodily stature, for contemptible woman becomes so
small here that the warrior, whose stature is in proportion
to his powers, requires quite a number of females to
supply his wants.<a id="FNanchor_XII-37" href="#Footnote_XII-37" class="fnanchor">[XII-37]</a></p>

<p>The Ukiahs, Sanéls, and others sprinkle food about the
favorite haunts of the dead. The mother, for instance,
while chanting her mournful ditty over the grave of her
dead babe sprinkles the nourishing milk in the air.<a id="FNanchor_XII-38" href="#Footnote_XII-38" class="fnanchor">[XII-38]</a></p>

<p>Many of the Nevada tribes thought that several heavens
await the soul, each with a degree of bliss in proportion
to the merits of the dead person; but this belief was
not well defined; nor was that of the Snakes, who killed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_525">525</a></span>
the favorite horse, and even wife, for the deceased, that
he might not be lonely.<a id="FNanchor_XII-39" href="#Footnote_XII-39" class="fnanchor">[XII-39]</a> The Allequas supposed that
before the soul could enter the ever-green prairies to live
its second life, free from want and sorrow, it had expiated
its sins in the form of some animal, weak, or strong, bad
or good, often passing from a lower to a higher grade,
according to the earthly conduct of the deceased. By
eating prairie-dogs and other game, some sought to gather
souls, apparently with a view to increase the purity of
their own and shorten the preparatory term.<a id="FNanchor_XII-40" href="#Footnote_XII-40" class="fnanchor">[XII-40]</a> The
San Diego tribes, on the other hand, who considered
large game as the embodied spirits of certain generations,
abstained from their flesh, evidently fearing that
such fare would hasten their metamorphosis; but old
men, whose term of life was nearly run, were not deterred
by these fears.</p>

<p class="sidenote">METEMPSYCHOSIS IN CALIFORNIA.</p>

<p>Ideas of metempsychosis also appear in one of the
songs of a Southern Californian tribe, which runs: As
the moon dies to be reborn, so the soul of man will be renewed.
Yet this people professed no belief in a future
reward, or punishment. It is doubtless the same people,
living near Monterey, of whom Marmier says, they supposed
that the dead retired to certain verdant isles in
the sea, while awaiting the birth of the infants whose
souls they were to form. Others regarded these islands
as paradise, and placed hell in a mountain chasm.<a id="FNanchor_XII-41" href="#Footnote_XII-41" class="fnanchor">[XII-41]</a></p>

<p>Among the Acagchemems we meet with a peculiar
pantheistic notion. Death was regarded as an invisible
entity constituting the air, which also formed the soul
of man, or his breath, whose particular seat was the
heart. As man became decrepit, his soul was gradually
absorbed in the element which had originated it, until it
finally became merged and lost therein. But this was
the belief of some only among the tribe. Others supposed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_526">526</a></span>
that they would go to <i>tolmec</i>, the abode of the great
Chinigchinich, situated below the earth, abounding in
sensual pleasures, unembittered by sorrow, and where
food and other wants were supplied without labor. Still
others held that Chinigchinich sent the soul, or the
heart, as they expressed it, to different places, according
to the station in life and manner of death of the deceased.
Thus, chiefs and medicine-men, whom Tacu, the eater of
human flesh, honored by devouring, became heavenly
bodies, while those who died by drowning, or in captivity,
and could not be eaten by Tacu, went elsewhere.
Souls of common people were consigned to some undefined,
though evidently happy, place, since they were
obliged to pass a probationary term on the borders of the
sea, on mountains, in valleys, or forests, whence they
came to commune with, or among, their widows or relatives,
who often burned or razed the house to be saved
from such visits.<a id="FNanchor_XII-42" href="#Footnote_XII-42" class="fnanchor">[XII-42]</a></p>

<p>The Mojaves have more liberal ideas and admit all to
share the joys of heaven. With the smoke curling upwards
from the pyre, the soul rises and floats eastward to
the regions of the rising sun, whither Matevil has gone
before, and where a second earth-life awaits it, free from
want and sorrow. But if its purity be sullied by crime,
or stained with human blood, the soul is transformed
into a rat and must remain for four days in a rat-hole
to be purified before Matevil can receive it. According
to some, Matevil dwells in a certain lofty mountain lying
in the Mojave territory.<a id="FNanchor_XII-43" href="#Footnote_XII-43" class="fnanchor">[XII-43]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">FUTURE OF MARICOPAS, YUMAS, APACHES, MOQUIS.</p>

<p>The Pimas also believe that the soul<a id="FNanchor_XII-44" href="#Footnote_XII-44" class="fnanchor">[XII-44]</a> goes to the east,
to the sun-house perhaps, there to live with Sehuiab,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_527">527</a></span>
the son of the creator, but this Elysium is not perfect,
for a devil called Chiawat is admitted there, and he
greatly plagues the inmates.<a id="FNanchor_XII-45" href="#Footnote_XII-45" class="fnanchor">[XII-45]</a> The Maricopas are stated
in one account to believe in a future state exactly similar
to the life on earth, with all its social distinctions and
wants, so that in order to enable the soul to assume its
proper position among the spirits, all the property of the
deceased, as well as a great part of that of his relatives,
is offered up at the grave. But according to Bartlett
they think the dead will return to their ancient home
on the banks of the Colorado, and live on the sand hills.
Here the different parts of the body will be transformed
into animals, the head, for instance, becoming an owl,
the hands, bats, the feet, wolves, and in these forms continue
their ancient feuds with the Yumas, who expelled
them from that country.<a id="FNanchor_XII-46" href="#Footnote_XII-46" class="fnanchor">[XII-46]</a> The Yumas, however, do not
conform to these views, but expect that the good soul
will leave worldly strife for a pleasant valley hidden in
one of the cañons of the Colorado, and that the wicked
will be shut up in a dark cavern to be tantalized by the
view of the bliss beyond their reach.<a id="FNanchor_XII-47" href="#Footnote_XII-47" class="fnanchor">[XII-47]</a></p>

<p>The Apaches believe in metempsychosis and consider
the rattlesnake as the form to be assumed by the wicked
after death. The owl, the eagle, and perfectly white birds,
were regarded as possessing souls of divine origin, and
the bear was not less sacred in their estimation, for the
very daughter of Montezuma, whom it had carried off
from her father's home, was the mother of its race.<a id="FNanchor_XII-48" href="#Footnote_XII-48" class="fnanchor">[XII-48]</a>
The Moquis, went so far as to suppose that they would
return to the primeval condition of animals, plants, and
inanimate objects.<a id="FNanchor_XII-49" href="#Footnote_XII-49" class="fnanchor">[XII-49]</a> The faith of the other Pueblo tribes
in New Mexico was more in accordance with their cultured
condition, namely, that the soul would be judged
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_528">528</a></span>
immediately after death according to its deeds. Food
was placed with the dead, and stones were thrown upon
the body to drive out the evil spirit. On a certain night,
in August it seems, the soul haunted the hills near its
former home to receive the tributes of food and drink
which affectionate friends hastened to offer. Scoffers
connected the disappearance of the choice viands with
the rotund form of the priests.<a id="FNanchor_XII-50" href="#Footnote_XII-50" class="fnanchor">[XII-50]</a></p>

<p>The Navajos expected to return to their place whence
they originated, below the earth, where all kinds of
fruits and cereals, germinated from the seeds lost
above, grow in unrivaled luxuriance. Released from
their earthly bonds the spirits proceed to an extensive
marsh in which many a soul is bemired through relying
too much on its own efforts, and failing to ask
the aid of the great spirit; or, perhaps the outfit of
live stock and implements offered at the grave has
been inadequate to the journey. After wandering
about for four days the more fortunate souls come to
a ladder conducting to the under world; this they
descend and are gladdened by the sight of two great
spirits, male and female, who sit combing their hair.
After looking on for a few suns imbibing lessons of
cleanliness, perhaps, they climb up to the swamp again
to be purified, and then return to the abode of the
spirits to live in peace and plenty for ever. Some
believe that the bad become coyotes, and that women
turn into fishes, and then into other forms.<a id="FNanchor_XII-51" href="#Footnote_XII-51" class="fnanchor">[XII-51]</a></p>

<p>Among the Comanches we find the orthodox American
paradise, in its full glory. In the direction of the
setting sun lie the happy prairies, where the buffalo lead
the hunter in the glorious chase, and where the horse
of the pale-face aids those who have excelled in scalping
and horse-stealing, to attain supreme felicity. At night
they are permitted to revisit the earth, but must return
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_529">529</a></span>
before the break of day.<a id="FNanchor_XII-52" href="#Footnote_XII-52" class="fnanchor">[XII-52]</a> In striking contrast
to this idea stands the curious belief said to have been
held by the Pericúis of Lower California. Their great
spirit Niparaya hated war, and to deter his people from
engaging therein, consigned all those slain in battle to
Tuparan or Wac, a spirit who rising in rebellion against
the peace-loving Niparaya was deprived of all luxuries,
and imprisoned in a cave by the sea, guarded by
whales. Yet a number openly professed themselves
adherents of this personage. The Cochimís, who appear
to have had nearly the same belief, declare that it was
the bad spirits who sought to secure the soul and hold
it captive in the cave. Whatever may be the correct
version, their belief in a future state, says Baegert, is
evident from the custom of putting sandals on the feet
of the dead.<a id="FNanchor_XII-53" href="#Footnote_XII-53" class="fnanchor">[XII-53]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE REALM OF MUCCHITA.</p>

<p>The souls of the Sonora Indians dwell in the caves
and among the rocks of the cliffs, and the echoes heard
there are their clamoring voices.<a id="FNanchor_XII-54" href="#Footnote_XII-54" class="fnanchor">[XII-54]</a> Ribas declares that
in one part of Sinaloa a future state was ignored, yet
he says that they acknowledged a supreme mother and
her son, who was the first man.<a id="FNanchor_XII-55" href="#Footnote_XII-55" class="fnanchor">[XII-55]</a> In Nayarit we
come upon the Mexican idea of different heavens, determined
by the mode of death. Thus, children and
those who were carried off by disease went to one place;
those who died a violent death, to the air regions, where
they became shooting stars. The others went to <i>mucchita</i>,
placed somewhere in the district of Rosario, where they
lived under the care of men with shaven heads. During
the day they were allowed to consort with the living,
in the form of flies, to seek food; but at night they
returned to the mucchita to assume the human form
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_530">530</a></span>
and pass the time in dancing. At one time they could be
released from this abode, but owing to the imprudence
of one man, this privilege was lost. This person one
day made a trip to the coast to procure salt, leaving
his wife to take care of the house. After a short
absence he returned, in time only to see her disappear
in the mucchita, whither the spirits had beckoned her.
His sorrow was boundless, for he loved his wife dearly.
At last his tears and sighs touched the heart of the
keeper of the souls, who told him to watch for his
wife one night when she appeared in the dance, and
wound her with an arrow: she would then recognize
him and return home; but he warned him not to speak
a loud word, or she would disappear forever. The
man did as he was told, wounded his wife on the leg,
and had the joy to see her return home. Musicians
and singers were called in, and a grand feast was held
to celebrate the event; but, overcome with excitement,
the husband gave vent to a shout of joy. The next
moment the warning of the keeper was verified&mdash;a
ghastly corpse had taken the place of the wife. Since
then no other soul has been allowed to rejoin the
living.<a id="FNanchor_XII-56" href="#Footnote_XII-56" class="fnanchor">[XII-56]</a> It is curious to note in how many countries
the doctrine of a future life has been connected with the
legend of some hero who has died, descended into the
under-world, and again risen to life. How closely does
this American legend resemble the old story of Orpheus
and Eurydice; the death and resurrection of the Egyptian
Osiris; the Mithraic Mysteries of Persia, in which
the initiated, in dumb show, died and rose again from
the coffin; the Indian Mahadeva searching for the lifeless
Sita, and made glad by his resuscitation; the recovery
of Atys by Cybele among the Phrygians; the return
of Kore to Demeter for half of every year in the
Elusinian Mysteries; the mock murder and new birth of
the impersonated Zagreus, in the Bacchic Mysteries; the
Metamorphoses in the Celtic and Druidic Mysteries

<p class="sidenote">EICUT AND YOÁTOTOWEE.</p>

<p>An equally devoted husband was the Neeshenam
whose story is told by Mr Powers in the following
legend:&mdash;"First of all things existed the moon. The
moon created man, some say in the form of a stone,
others say in the form of a simple, straight, hairless,
limbless mass of flesh, like an enormous earth-worm, from
which he gradually developed into his present shape.
The first man thus created was called Eicut; his wife,
Yoátotowee. In process of time Yoátotowee fell sick,
and though Eicut nursed her tenderly, she gradually
faded away before his eyes and died. He loved her
with a love passing the love of brothers, and now his
heart was broken with grief. He dug a grave for her
close beside his camp-fire (for the Neeshenams did not
burn the dead then), that he might daily and hourly
weep above her silent dust. His grief knew no bounds.
His life became a burden to him; all the light was gone
out of his eyes, and all this world was black and dreary.
He wished to die, that he might follow his beloved
Yoátotowee. In the greatness of his grief he fell into a
trance, there was a rumbling in the ground, and the
spirit of the dead Yoátotowee arose out of her grave and
came and stood beside him. When he awoke out of his
trance and beheld his wife, he would have spoken to her,
but she forbade him, for in what moment an Indian
speaks to a ghost he dies. She turned away and set out
to seek the spirit-land (<i>oóshwooshe koom</i>, literally, 'the
dance-house of ghosts.') Eicut followed her, but the
ghost turned and said, 'why do you follow me? you are
not dead.' They journeyed on through a great country
and a darksome&mdash;a land that no man has seen and returned
to report&mdash;until they came to a river that separated
them from the spirit-land. Over this river there
was a bridge of one small rope, so very narrow that a
spider could hardly cross over it. Here the spirit of
Yoátotowee must bid farewell to her husband and go
over alone into the spirit-land. But the great unspeakable
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_532">532</a></span>
grief of Eicut at beholding his wife leaving him forever
overcame his love of life, and he called aloud after
her. In that self-same instant he died&mdash;for no Indian
can speak to a ghost and live&mdash;and together they entered
the land of spirits. Thus Eicut passed away from the
realm of earth, and in the invisible world became a good
and quiet spirit, who constantly watches over and befriends
his posterity still living on earth. But he and
his wife left behind them two children, a brother and a
sister; and to prevent incest the moon created another
pair and from these two pairs are descended all the
Neeshenams of to-day."<a id="FNanchor_XII-57" href="#Footnote_XII-57" class="fnanchor">[XII-57]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE SUN HOUSE AND TLALOCAN.</p>

<p>The future abode of the Mexicans had three divisions
to which the dead were admitted according to their rank
in life and manner of death. Glorious as was the fate
of the warrior who died in the cause of his country, on
the battle-field, or in the hands of the enemy's priests,
still more glorious was the destiny that awaited his soul.
The fallen Viking was carried by radiant Valkyries to
Valhalla, but the Aztec hero was borne in the arms of
Teoyaomique herself, the consort of Huitzilopochtli, to
the bright plains of the sun-house, in the eastern part of
the heavens, where shady groves, trees loaded with
luscious fruit, and flowers steeped in honey, vied with
the attractions of vast hunting-parks, to make his time
pass happily. Here also awaited him the presents sent
by affectionate friends below. Every morning when the
sun set out upon his journey, these bright strong warriors
seized their weapons<a id="FNanchor_XII-58" href="#Footnote_XII-58" class="fnanchor">[XII-58]</a> and marched before him,
shouting and fighting sham battles. This continued until
they reached the zenith, where the sun was transferred
to the charge of the Celestial Women, after which
the warriors dispersed to the chase or the shady grove.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_533">533</a></span>
The members of the new escort were women who had
died in war or child-bed, and lived in the western part
of the Sun House. Dressed like the warriors in martial
accoutrement,<a id="FNanchor_XII-59" href="#Footnote_XII-59" class="fnanchor">[XII-59]</a> they conducted the sun to his home,
some carrying the litter of quetzal feathers in which he
reclined, while others went in front shouting and fighting
gaily. Arrived at the extreme west they transferred
the sun to the dead of Mictlan, and went in quest of
their spindles, shuttles, baskets, and other implements
necessary for weaving or household work.<a id="FNanchor_XII-60" href="#Footnote_XII-60" class="fnanchor">[XII-60]</a> The only
other persons who are mentioned as being admitted to
the Sun House, were merchants who died on their journey.
After four years of this life the souls of the warriors
pass into birds of beautiful plumage, which live on
the honey of flowers growing in the celestial gardens
or seek their sustenance on earth.<a id="FNanchor_XII-61" href="#Footnote_XII-61" class="fnanchor">[XII-61]</a></p>

<p>The second place of bliss was Tlalocan, the abode of
Tlaloc, a terrestrial paradise, the source of the rivers
and all the nourishment of the earth, where joy reigns
and sorrow is unknown,<a id="FNanchor_XII-62" href="#Footnote_XII-62" class="fnanchor">[XII-62]</a> where every imaginable product
of the field and garden grows in profusion beneath
a perpetual summer sky. This paradise appears to
have been erected on the ideal reminiscences of the
happy Tollan, the cradle of the race, where their fathers
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_534">534</a></span>
reveled in riches and splendor. To this place went
those who had been killed by lightning, the drowned,
those suffering from itch, gout, tumors, dropsy, leprosy
and other incurable diseases. Children also, at least
those who were sacrificed to the Tlalocs, played about
in its gardens, and once a year they descended among
the living in an invisible form to join in their festivals.<a id="FNanchor_XII-63" href="#Footnote_XII-63" class="fnanchor">[XII-63]</a>
It is doubtful, however, whether this paradise
was perpetual, for according to some authors the diseased
stayed here but a short time, and then passed
on to Mictlan; while the children, balked of their life
by death or sacrifice, were allowed to essay it again.<a id="FNanchor_XII-64" href="#Footnote_XII-64" class="fnanchor">[XII-64]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">MICTLAN.</p>

<p>The third destination of the dead, provided for those
who died of ordinary diseases or old age, and, accordingly,
for the great majority, was Mictlan, 'the place of
the dead,' which is described as a vast, pathless place, a
land of darkness and desolation, where the dead after
their time of probation are sunk in a sleep that knows
no waking. In addressing the corpse they spoke of this
place of Mictlan as a 'most obscure land, where light
cometh not, and whence none can ever return.'<a id="FNanchor_XII-65" href="#Footnote_XII-65" class="fnanchor">[XII-65]</a> There
are several points, however, given by Sahagun, as well
as other writers, which tend to modify this aspect of
Mictlan. The lords and nobles seem even here to have
kept up the barriers which separated them from the contaminating
touch of inferiors, and doubtless the good
and respectable were classed apart from low miscreants
and criminals, for there were nine divisions in Mictlan,
of which Chicohnahuimictlan or Ninth-Mictlan, was the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_535">535</a></span>
abode of the Aztec Pluto and his Proserpine. This name
seems also to have been applied to the whole region,
meaning then the nine Mictlans.<a id="FNanchor_XII-66" href="#Footnote_XII-66" class="fnanchor">[XII-66]</a> The different idol-mantles
in which the dead person was attired, determined
by his profession and by his manner of death,
would imply that different gods had control of these
divisions.<a id="FNanchor_XII-67" href="#Footnote_XII-67" class="fnanchor">[XII-67]</a> Whatever distinction there may have been
was kept up by the humbler or richer offerings of food,
clothing, implements, and slaves, made at the time of the
burial, at the end of eighty days, and on the first, second
third, and fourth anniversary of the death; all of which
went before Mictlantecutli before being turned over to
the use of the person for whom they were destined.<a id="FNanchor_XII-68" href="#Footnote_XII-68" class="fnanchor">[XII-68]</a> In
one place Sahagun states that four years were passed in
traveling before the soul reached Mictlan, and on another
page he distinctly implies that this term was passed
within that region, when he says that the dead awoke
from their sleep as the sun reached the western horizon,
and rose to escort it through their land; Torquemada
says that four days were occupied in the journey.<a id="FNanchor_XII-69" href="#Footnote_XII-69" class="fnanchor">[XII-69]</a> The
only way to reconcile these statements is by supposing
that the soul passed from one division to another, until
it finally, at the end of the four years, reached Mictlan
proper, or Ninth-Mictlan, and attained repose. Their
duties during this term consisting in escorting the sun,
and working like their happier brethren in the Sun
House, besides passing a certain time in sleep. The fact
that the people besought the dead to visit them during
the festival in their honor, implies that they were within
Mictlan, though their liberty there, at that season,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_536">536</a></span>
at least, was not so very restricted. 'As they helped to
escort the sun, we must suppose that they also enjoyed
the blessings of sunshine while terrestrial beings slept,
and the expression of Tezozomoc, a place where none
knows whether it be night or day, a place of eternal
rest,' must refer to those only who have passed the time
of probation, and lapsed into the final sleep. It may be
however, that the sun was lustreless at night, for Camargo
states that it slept after its journey.<a id="FNanchor_XII-70" href="#Footnote_XII-70" class="fnanchor">[XII-70]</a> If so, the
dim twilight noticed among the northern people, or the
moon, the deity of the night, must have replaced the
obscured brightness of the sun, if lights indeed were
needed, for the escort and the workers could scarcely
have used artificial illumination. The route of the sun
further indicates that Mictlan was situated in the antipodean
regions, or rather in the centre of the earth, to
which the term 'dark and pathless regions' also applies.
This is the supposition of Clavigero, who bases it on the
fact that Tlalxicco, the name of Mictlantecutli's temple,
signifies center or bowels of the earth.<a id="FNanchor_XII-71" href="#Footnote_XII-71" class="fnanchor">[XII-71]</a> But Sahagun
and others place it in the north, and support this assertion
by showing that <i>Mictlampa</i> signified north.<a id="FNanchor_XII-72" href="#Footnote_XII-72" class="fnanchor">[XII-72]</a> The
fact that the people turned the face to the north when calling
upon the dead,<a id="FNanchor_XII-73" href="#Footnote_XII-73" class="fnanchor">[XII-73]</a> is strongly in favor of this theory;
the north is also the dark quarter. These apparently contradictory
statements may be reconciled by supposing
that Mictlan was situated in the northern part of the
subterranean regions, as the home of the heroes was in
the eastern part of the heavens.</p>

<p>As the warrior in the Sun House passes after four
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_537">537</a></span>
years of perfect enjoyment into a seemingly less happy
state, so the Mictlan probationer appears to have abandoned
his work for a condition of everlasting repose.<a id="FNanchor_XII-74" href="#Footnote_XII-74" class="fnanchor">[XII-74]</a>
This condition is already indicated by the very signification
of the name Mictlan, 'place of the dead,' and by
the preceding statements; it also implied by the myth of
the creation of man, wherein the god-heroes say to
Xolotl: Go beg of Mictlantecutli, Lord of Hades, that he
may give thee a bone or some ashes of the dead that are
with him.<a id="FNanchor_XII-75" href="#Footnote_XII-75" class="fnanchor">[XII-75]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE JOURNEY OF THE DEAD.</p>

<p>I will now revert to the terrible four days' journey,<a id="FNanchor_XII-76" href="#Footnote_XII-76" class="fnanchor">[XII-76]</a>
which those who were unfortunate enough to
die a peaceful death had to perform before they could
attain their negative happiness. Fully impressed with
the idea of its hardships, the friends of the deceased
held it to be a religious duty to provide him with a full
outfit of food, clothing, implements, and even slaves, to
enable him to pass safely through the ordeal. Idols were
also deposited by his side, and if the dead man were a
lord, his chaplain was sent to attend to their service.
This maintenance of worship during the journey is also
implied by the sprinkling of water upon the ashes with
the words: Let the dead wash himself.<a id="FNanchor_XII-77" href="#Footnote_XII-77" class="fnanchor">[XII-77]</a> The officiating
priests, laid, besides, passports with the body,
which were to serve for various points along the road.
The first papers passed him by two mountains, which,
like the symplegades, threatened to meet and crush him
in their embrace. The second was a pass for the road
guarded by a big snake; the other papers took him by
the green crocodile, Xochitonal, across eight deserts, and
over eight hills. Then came the freezing <i>itzehecaya</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_538">538</a></span>
'wind of knives,' which hurls stones and knives upon
the traveler, who now more than ever finds the offerings
of his friends of service. How the poor soul escaped this
ordeal is not stated. Lastly he came to the broad river
Chiconahuapan 'nine waters,' which could be crossed
only upon the back of a dog of reddish color, which was
killed for this purposes by thrusting an arrow down its
throat, and was burnt with the corpse. According to
Gomara, the dog served for a guide to Mictlan, but other
authors state that it preceded its master, and when he
arrived at the river, he found it on the opposite bank,
waiting with a number of others for their owners. As
soon as the dog recognized its master, it swam over, and
bore him safely across the rushing current. A cotton
string tied round its neck when placed upon the pyre
may have served to distinguish it from other dogs, or as
a passport.<a id="FNanchor_XII-78" href="#Footnote_XII-78" class="fnanchor">[XII-78]</a> The traveler was now taken before Mictlantecutli,
to whom he presented the passports together
with gifts consisting of candlewood, perfume-canes, soft
threads of plain and colored cotton, a piece of cloth, a
mantle and other articles of clothing, and was thereupon
assigned to his sphere. Women underwent the same
ordeal.<a id="FNanchor_XII-79" href="#Footnote_XII-79" class="fnanchor">[XII-79]</a> Camargo mentions a paradise above the nine
heavens, occupied by the goddess of love, where dwarfs,
fools, and hunchbacks danced and sang for her amusement,
but whether these beings were of human or divine
origin is not stated.<a id="FNanchor_XII-80" href="#Footnote_XII-80" class="fnanchor">[XII-80]</a> At times the old chroniclers consider
Mictlan as a place of punishment,<a id="FNanchor_XII-81" href="#Footnote_XII-81" class="fnanchor">[XII-81]</a> but the priests
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_539">539</a></span>
in their homilies never appear to have urged repentance
for the purpose of escaping future punishment, but merely
to avoid earthly inflictions, visited upon them or their
children.<a id="FNanchor_XII-82" href="#Footnote_XII-82" class="fnanchor">[XII-82]</a> The philanthropist whose whole life had
been one continuous act of benevolence, the wise prince
who had lived but for his country's good, the saintly hermit,
the pious priest who had passed his days in perpetual
fasts, penance, and self-torture, all were consigned
to Mictlan, together with the drunkard, the murderer,
the thief, and none were exempt from the terrible
journey, or from the long probation which ends in eternal
sleep. They may have accounted to themselves for the
manifest unfairness of this system by means of their
belief in predestination, which taught that the sign under
which a man was born determined to a great extent, if
not entirely, his character, career, and consequently his
future.<a id="FNanchor_XII-83" href="#Footnote_XII-83" class="fnanchor">[XII-83]</a> Mictlan cannot, therefore, be regarded as a hell;
it is but a place of negative punishment, a Nirvâna, in
which the soul is at last blown out and lost.<a id="FNanchor_XII-84" href="#Footnote_XII-84" class="fnanchor">[XII-84]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE FUTURE OF THE TLASCALTECS.</p>

<p>The Tlascaltecs supposed that the souls of people of
rank entered after death into the bodies of the higher
animals, or even into clouds and gems, while common
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_540">540</a></span>
souls passed into lower animal forms.<a id="FNanchor_XII-85" href="#Footnote_XII-85" class="fnanchor">[XII-85]</a> With the Mexicans
they believed that little children who died were
given another trial of earth-life.<a id="FNanchor_XII-86" href="#Footnote_XII-86" class="fnanchor">[XII-86]</a> In Goatzacoalco the
bones of the dead were so placed that the soul might
have no difficulty in finding them.<a id="FNanchor_XII-87" href="#Footnote_XII-87" class="fnanchor">[XII-87]</a> In the Aztec creation-myth
we have seen that out of bone man was
formed, and Brinton considers this, together with instances
of the careful preservation of remains to be
noticed in different parts of America, evidence of a widespread
belief that the soul resided in the bones. This
receives further confirmation in the Quiché legend which
relates that the bones of certain heroes were ground to
powder to prevent their removal.<a id="FNanchor_XII-88" href="#Footnote_XII-88" class="fnanchor">[XII-88]</a> Yet the idea does not
accord with the Mexican custom of placing a stone
between the lips of the dead to serve as heart, and,
doubtless, to hold the soul as the Quichés supposed.
Either instance, however, implies a belief in several
souls, although no reference is made to such plurality.
The Tlascaltecs had guardian spirits which were embodied
in the idols called <i>tepictoton</i>, and Camargo mentions
angels who inhabited the air and influenced thunder,
winds, and other phenomena, and who were doubtless
the children of Tlalocan.<a id="FNanchor_XII-89" href="#Footnote_XII-89" class="fnanchor">[XII-89]</a> A devil they could
scarcely have had, for evil mingled too liberally in the
nature of most of the Mexican gods to admit of its personification
by one alone. The nearest approach to our
Satan was to be found in a phantom called Tlacatecolotl,
the 'owlish one'<a id="FNanchor_XII-90" href="#Footnote_XII-90" class="fnanchor">[XII-90]</a> who roamed about doing mischief;
to see an owl was accordingly held to be an evil sign,
and much dreaded. Will o' the wisps were regarded as
transformed wizards and witches, or animals.<a id="FNanchor_XII-91" href="#Footnote_XII-91" class="fnanchor">[XII-91]</a> The
Tlascaltecs supposed that the sparks which sped away
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_541">541</a></span>
from the craters of volcanoes were the souls of tyrants
sent forth by the gods to torment the people.<a id="FNanchor_XII-92" href="#Footnote_XII-92" class="fnanchor">[XII-92]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">FUTURE OF THE OTOMIS, MIZTECS, AND MAYAS.</p>

<p>The Otomís believed that the soul died with the
body,<a id="FNanchor_XII-93" href="#Footnote_XII-93" class="fnanchor">[XII-93]</a> while the Tarascos, according to Herrera, admitted
a future judgment, with its accompaniments of
heaven and hell, but to judge from their burial customs,
with immolation of attendants, term of mourning, and so
forth, it would appear that they had the same belief as
the Aztecs.<a id="FNanchor_XII-94" href="#Footnote_XII-94" class="fnanchor">[XII-94]</a></p>

<p>The Miztecs placed the gates of paradise within the
cavern of Chalcatongo, and the grandees of the kingdom
were therefore eager to be buried within its precincts,
in order to be near the abode of bliss. The Zapotecs
placed the heavenly portals within the cave of Mictlan.
Their heaven must accordingly have been situated within
the earth, although the custom of placing the dead
with their feet towards the east indicates that it lay toward
the sunny morning land. The common people at
least seem, like the Aztecs, to have been required to pass
a probationary term before entering the holy place, and
during this period they were permitted to visit their
friends on earth once a year, and partake of the repast
spread for them. The Zapotecs gave as a reason for interring
the dead, that those who were burned failed to
reach heaven.<a id="FNanchor_XII-95" href="#Footnote_XII-95" class="fnanchor">[XII-95]</a></p>

<p class="p2">The Mayas believed in a place of everlasting delight,
where the good should recline in voluptuous repose
beneath the shade of the <i>yaxché</i>,<a id="FNanchor_XII-96" href="#Footnote_XII-96" class="fnanchor">[XII-96]</a> indulging in dainty
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_542">542</a></span>
food and delicious drinks. Those who died by hanging
were especially sure of admittance to this paradise, for
their goddess Ixtab carried them thither herself, and
many enthusiasts committed suicide with this expectation.
The wicked, on the other hand, descended into
Mitnal,<a id="FNanchor_XII-97" href="#Footnote_XII-97" class="fnanchor">[XII-97]</a> a sphere below this, where hunger and other
torments awaited them. Cacao money was laid with
the body to pay its way, and frequent offerings of food
were made, but the funeral was not proceeded with until
the fifth day, when the soul had entered its sphere.
A trace of metempsychosis may be noticed in the superstitious
belief that sorcerers transformed people into animals.<a id="FNanchor_XII-98" href="#Footnote_XII-98" class="fnanchor">[XII-98]</a></p>

<p>Whether the Quichés believed in a future reward and
punishment is uncertain, for on the one hand we are
told that Xibalba, which implies a place of terror, was
their hell, where ruled two princes bearing the suggestive
names of One Death and Seven Deaths; while, on
the other hand, the sacrifice of slaves and other objects,
implies a negative punishment. A gentle, unwarlike
tribe of Guatemala is said to have had a belief similar
to that of the Pericuis, namely that a future life was accorded
to those only who died a natural death, and,
therefore, they left the bodies of the slain to beasts and
vultures.<a id="FNanchor_XII-99" href="#Footnote_XII-99" class="fnanchor">[XII-99]</a> The Pipiles appear to have looked forward to
the same future abodes as the Mexicans, and to the
same dreadful journey after death. During the four
days and four nights that the soul was on the road, the
mourners wailed deeply, probably with fear for its
safety, but on the fifth day, when the priest announced
that it had reached the goal, the lamentation ceased.
During this time also, the mother whose infant had departed
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_543">543</a></span>
withheld the milk from all other children, lest
the thirsty little wanderer should be angry, and smite
the usurper.<a id="FNanchor_XII-100" href="#Footnote_XII-100" class="fnanchor">[XII-100]</a> The probationary routine of the spirits
appears to have called them to the earth at intervals, for
a legend of the isles of Lake Ilopango recounts that at
certain times of the year spectre barks glide in silence
over the tranquil waters of the lake, anointing every
island from the least to the greatest, offering upon each
to some bloody divinity of past times a human victim,
an infant chosen by lot.<a id="FNanchor_XII-101" href="#Footnote_XII-101" class="fnanchor">[XII-101]</a></p>

went to the sunrise regions, the abode of Tamagostat
and Cipattonal, who welcomed them with the title of
'our children.' But all the good, that is those who had
obeyed and reverenced the gods, were admitted here,
whether warriors or not, and strong must have been
their faith in the bliss that awaited them, for the
virgins, says Andagoya, who were cast as offerings into
the seething lava streams of the volcano met their fate
without fear.<a id="FNanchor_XII-103" href="#Footnote_XII-103" class="fnanchor">[XII-103]</a> The wicked were doomed to annihilation

<p>Writing on the customs of Dabaiba, Peter Martyr
says: 'They are such simple men, that they know not
how to call the soule, nor vnderstand the power thereof:
whereupon, they often talk among themselues with admiration
what that inuisible and not intelligible essence
might bee, whereby the members of men and brute
beastes should be moued: I know not what secret thing
they say, should liue after the corporall life. That (I
know not what) they beleeue that after this peregrination,
if it liued without spott, and reserued that masse
committed vnto it without iniury done to any, it shoulde
goe to a certayne æternall felicity: contrary, if it shall
suffer the same to be corrupted with any filthy lust,
violent rapine, or raging furie, they say, it shall finde a
thousande tortures in rough and vnpleasant places vnder
the Center: and speaking these things, lifting vpp their
the handes they shewe the heauens, and after that casting
right hand down, they poynt to the wombe of the
earth'! Their belief in a future punishment he further
illustrates by relating that 'the thicke spott seene in the
globe of the Moone, at the full, is a mann, and they beleeue
hee was cast out to the moyst, and colde Circle of
the Moone, that hee might perpetually bee tormented
betweene those two passions, in suffering colde, and moysture,
for incest committed with his sister.'<a id="FNanchor_XII-109" href="#Footnote_XII-109" class="fnanchor">[XII-109]</a></p>

<p class="p2">The following myths, for which I am indebted to the
kindness and industrious investigation of Mr Powers,
having come to hand too late for insertion in their
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_545">545</a></span>
proper places I avail myself of the opportunity to give
them here:&mdash;There dwells, say the Neeshenams, upon the
hills and in the forests, a ghost named Bóhem Cülleh,
which is at once man and woman. It is a bad spirit, but
nevertheless a useful one to those who seek its aid, and
these are mostly bad people. Sometimes in the night its
wierd eldritch cry is heard in the forest, and then some
woman about to be overtaken in dishonest childbirth goes
out into the woods alone, with her shame and her pangs
upon her, and having brought forth, presently returns,
crying and lamenting that the wicked ghost met and
overcame her and that she has conceived of the spirit.
Or perhaps it is a man who has wrought an evil thing
who makes this bad spirit responsible for his wickedness.
Either a man or a woman wandering alone in the forest
is exposed to the enticements of the ghost Bóhem Cülleh,
to commit fornication with it.</p>

<p class="sidenote">THE COYOTE'S ELOPEMENT.</p>

<p>'The Coyote's Elopement' forms the subject of another
Neeshenam tale. It is as follows&mdash;The coyote and the
bat were one day gathering the soft-shelled nuts of the
sugar pine, when there came along two women-deer
(the only way they have of expressing 'female deer'),
who were the wives of pigeons. The coyote, upon this,
took a handful of pitch and besmeared the bat's eyes so
that it could not see. The poor bat was totally blinded,
but it called upon the wind to blow, and its eyes were
opened a little, as we see them to-day. Meantime the
rascally coyote eloped with the two women-deer. But
it was not long before they came to a bridge so extremely
narrow that they could not pass over it. Just then there
came along a quail, and he took the two women-deer
and led them across, leaving the bigamous coyote in the
lurch. No sooner had they crossed than the sister of
the pigeons took the quail away to his mother's camp,
and thus the women-deer were set at liberty, and recovered
by their husbands, the pigeons.</p>

<p>"In this story," says Mr Powers, "as in many others,
we have something analogous to the were-wolves and
swan-maidens of the medieval legends. It also illustrates
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_546">546</a></span>
the Indian belief in the common origin of all animals.
Their favorite theory is, that the man originated from the
coyote, and the woman from the deer. Wherefore this
story probably gives us a glimpse of the first courtship
recorded of the human race, when the animals had so
developed, strictly in accordance with the Darwinian
programme, that man was about to appear upon the
scene. The failure of the coyote's elopement delayed
that auspicious event a little while."</p>

<p>Another Neeshenam legend relates that there was
once a medicine-man who possessed the wonderful faculty
of turning himself into a bear for a brief season. When
one of his patients was extremely ill, and, according to
custom, he sucked him to extract the injurious matter,
he would presently be seized with a spasm. Falling
upon all fours, he would find his hands and feet sprawled
along the ground in plantigrade fashion, his nails would
grow long and sharp, a short tail would sprout forth,
hair would spring up all over his body, in short he would
become a raging, roaring bear. When the spasm had
passed away, he would return to the human form.</p>

<p>According to yet another Neeshenam tradition, there
lived long, long ago a very terrible old man, whose chief
delight it was to kill and devour Indians. He had stone
mortars in which he pounded the flesh to make it tender
for eating. Far down on the Sacramento plains, thirty or
forty miles away, he and his wife lived together, and
around their wigwam the blood of Indians lay a foot
deep. The Indians all made war on them and tried to
kill them, but they could do nothing against them.
Then at last the Old Coyote took pity on the Indians
whom he had created, and he determined to kill this
old man. He was accustomed to go into the great round
dance-house when the Indians were assembled within
it, and slay the chief. So the Old Coyote dug a deep
hole just outside the door, and hid himself in it, armed
with a big knife. The knife was just on a level with the
ground, and when the old man came along, going into
the dance-house, he saw it, and gave a kick at it, but
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_547">547</a></span>
did not notice the Coyote, who immediately jumped out
of his hole, ran into the dance-house, and killed the old
man.</p>

<p>This story, Mr Powers thinks probably refers to some
long extinct race of cannibals who were superior in
power to the present race. "To them," he says, "may
be assigned the stone mortars found in so many parts of
California, which the Indians now living here confessedly
did not make. Others account for these stone
mortars by saying they were made by the chief of the
spirits, Haylin Kakeeny, and his subordinates."</p>

<p class="sidenote">SHASTA LEGENDS.</p>

<p>The following queer legends are, on the indisputable
authority of Mr Powers, of Shasta origin: The world
was created by Old Groundmole, <i>ídidoc</i>, a huge animal
that heaved creation into existence on its back, by
rooting underneath somewhere. When the flood came
it destroyed all animals except a squirrel, as large as a
bear, which exists to this day on a mountain called by
the Shastas, Wakwaynuma, near Happy Camp.</p>

<p>A long time ago there was a fire-stone in the distant
east, white and glistening, like the purest quartz; and the
coyote journeyed east, brought this fire-stone and
gave it to the Indians, and that was the origin of
fire.</p>

<p>Originally the sun had nine brothers, all, like himself,
flaming hot with fire, so that the world was
like to perish; but the coyote slew nine of the brothers,
and thus saved mankind from burning up. The
moon also had nine brothers, all like to himself,
made of the coldest ice, so that in the night people
went near to freeze to death. But the coyote went
away out on the eastern edge of the world with a
mighty big knife of flint stone, heated stones to keep his
hands warm, then laid hold of the nine moons, one after
another, and slew them likewise, and thus men got warm
again.</p>

<p>When it rains, there is some Indian sick in heaven,
weeping. Long, long ago there was a good young Indian
on earth, and when he died all the Indians cried so much
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_548">548</a></span>
that a flood came on the earth and rose up to heaven,
and drowned all people except one couple.</p>

<p>The Chénposels relate that there was once a man
who loved two women, and wished to marry them.
Now, these two women were magpies, <i>atchatch</i>, and they
loved him not, but laughed his wooing to scorn. Then
he fell into a rage and cursed these two women that
were magpies and went far away to the north, and there
he set the world on fire, made for himself a tule boat
in which he escaped to sea, and was never heard of
more. But the fire which he had kindled burned with
a mighty burning. It ate its way south with terrible
swiftness, licking up all things that are on earth&mdash;men,
trees, rocks, animals, water, and even the ground itself.
But the Old Coyote saw the burning and smoke from
his place far in the south, and he ran with all his might
to put it out. He took two little boys in a sack on
his back, and ran north like the wind. So fast did
he run that he gave out just as he got to the fire, and
dropped the two little boys. But he took Indian sugar
(honey dew) in his mouth, chewed it up, spat it on the
fire and put it out. Now the fire was out, but the Coyote
was very thirsty, but there was no water, so he
took Indian sugar again, chewed it up, dug a hole in
the bottom of the creek, covered up the sugar in it, and
it turned to water, and the earth thus had water again.
But the two little boys cried because they were lonely
for there was nobody on earth. Then the Coyote made
a sweat-house, and split up a great number of little
sticks, which he laid in the sweat-house over night; in
the morning they were all turned into men and women,
so the two little boys had company, and the earth was
repeopled.<a id="FNanchor_XII-110" href="#Footnote_XII-110" class="fnanchor">[XII-110]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">SUN-MYTH OF THE PALLAWONAPS.</p>

<p>I conclude with a sun-myth of the Pallawonaps, who
lived on Kern River in Southern California:&mdash;Pokòh
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_549">549</a></span>
made all things. Long ago the sun was a man. The sun
is bad and wishes to kill all things, but the moon is good.
The sun's rays are arrows, and he gives a bundle to every
creature, more to the lion, fewer to the coyote, etc.; but to
none does he give an arrow that will slay a man. The coyote
wished to go to the sun, and he asked Pokòh the road.
Pokòh pointed out to him a good road, and the coyote
traveled on it all day, but the sun turned round, so he
traveled in a circle, and came back at night to the place
whence he had started in the morning. A second time
he asked Pokòh, and a second time he came back
in a circle. Then Pokòh told him to go straight to the
eastern edge of the earth, and wait there until the sun
came up. So the coyote went and sat down on the hole
where the sun came up, with his back turned to the east,
and kept pointing with his arrow in every direction, pretending
he was going to shoot. The sun came up under him,
and told him to get out of the way. But the coyote sat
there until it became so warm that he was obliged to coil
up his tail under him. Then he began to get thirsty, and
asked the sun for water. The sun gave him an acorn-cup
full, but this did not satisfy the coyote's great thirst.
Next his shoulders began to get warm, so he spat on his
paws and rubbed his back with them. Then he said to
the sun, Why do you come up here, meddling with
me? But the sun said, I am not meddling with you;
I am traveling where I have a right to travel. The
coyote told him to go round some other way, that that
was his road, but the sun insisted on going straight up.
Then the coyote wanted to go up with him, so the good-natured
sun took him along. Presently they came to a
path with steps like a ladder, and as the sun went up he
counted the steps; when they got up above the world,
the coyote found it getting hot and wanted to jump down,
but the distance was too great. By noon the sun was
very hot and bright, and he told the coyote to shut his
eyes. He did so, but he opened them quickly again, and
so kept opening and shutting them all the afternoon, to
see how fast the sun was sliding down. When the sun
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_550">550</a></span>
came down to the earth in the west, the coyote jumped
off on to a tree, and so clambered down to the ground.<a id="FNanchor_XII-111" href="#Footnote_XII-111" class="fnanchor">[XII-111]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Such are the Myths of the Farthest West, such
the endeavors of these men unenlightened, according
to our ideas of enlightenment, to define the indefinable,
such the result of their 'yearning after the gods.' Most
of their myths and beliefs are extravagant, childish,
meaningless, to our understanding of them, but doubtless
our myths would be the same to them. From the
beginning of time men have grappled with shadows,
have accounted for material certainties by immaterial
uncertainties. Let us be content to gather and preserve
these perishable phantoms now; they will be very curious
relics in the day of the triumph of substance.</p>

<p>In nothing, perhaps, do the Native Races of the Pacific
States show signs of age, and of progress from absolute
primevalism, more than in their languages. Indeed,
throughout the length and breadth of the two Americas
aboriginal tongues display greater richness, more delicate
gradations, and a wider scope, than from the uncultured
condition in which the people were found, one
would be led to suppose. Until recently, no attention
has been given by scholars to these languages; now it is
admitted that the more they are studied the more do new
beauties appear, and that in their speech these nations
are in advance of what their general rudeness in other
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_552">552</a></span>
respects would imply. Nor is there that difference in
the construction of words and the scope of vocabularies
between nations which we call civilized and those called
savage, which, from the difference in their customs, industries,
and polities we should expect to find; from
which it is safe to infer that in progress, after the essential
corporeal requirements are satisfied, the necessities
of the intellect, of which speech is the very first, are
not only met, but are developed and gratified beyond
what the actual necessities of the body demand. That
is, speech or no speech the body must be fed or the
animal dies, but with the absolute necessities of the
body supplied, the intellect and its supernumeraries shoot
forward beyond their relative primeval state, leaving
bodily comforts far behind. Hence, in the very outset
of what we call progress, we see the intellect asserting
its independence and developing those organs only
which in their turn assist its own development.
Again, under certain conditions, two nations having advanced
materially and intellectually side by side up to a
certain point, may from extrinsic or incidental causes
become widely separate; one may go forward intellectually
while the two remain together substantially; one
may go forward materially while mentally there is no
apparent difference. The causes which give rise to these
strange inequalities we cannot fathom until we can
minutely retrace the progress of the people for thousands
of ages in their history; we only see, in the many examples
round us, that such is the fact. A people well
advanced in art and language may, from war or famine,
become reduced to primeval penury and yet retain traces
of its former culture in its speech, but by no possibility
can rude and barbaric speech suddenly assume depth
and richness from material prosperity; from all of which
it is safe to conclude that language is the surest test of
the age of a people, for the mind cannot expand without
an improvement in speech, and speech improves
only as it is forced slowly to develop under pressure of
the mind.

<p class="sidenote">RELATIONSHIP OF AMERICAN LANGUAGES.</p>

<p>The researches of the few philologists who have given
American languages their study have brought to light
the following facts. First, that a relationship exists
among all the tongues of the northern and southern continents;
and that while certain characteristics are found
in common throughout all the languages of America,
these languages are as a whole sufficiently peculiar to be
distinguishable from the speech of all the other races of
the world. Although some of these characteristics, as
a matter of course, are found in some of the languages
of the old world&mdash;more of them in the Turanian family
than in any other&mdash;yet nowhere on the globe are uniformities
of speech carried over vast areas and through
innumerable and diversified races with such persistency,
as in America; nowhere are tongues so dissimilar and
yet so alike as here. In this general similarity would
be a strong ground-work for a theory of common origin,
either indigenous or foreign, but for the fact that while
the languages of America appear distinct from all other
languages of the world, and do indeed in certain respects
bear a general resemblance one to another throughout,
yet at the same time I may safely assert that on no other
continent can there be found such a multitude of distinct
languages which definitely approach one another in
scarcely a single word or syllable as in America. It is
as easy to prove from language that the nations of the
New World were originally thrown together from different
parts, and that by intermigrations, uniformity in
customs and climate, and the lapse of long ages the
people have become approximately brethren in speech,
while their incessant wars have at the same time held
them asunder and prevented a more particular uniformity,
as it would be to prove a common origin and subsequent
dispersion; without further light both theories are
alike insusceptible of proof, as are, indeed, all hypotheses
concerning the origin of the native races of this continent.
Another fact which naturally becomes more
apparent the more we investigate the subject, particularly
as regards the nations inhabiting the western half of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_554">554</a></span>
North America, is, that the innumerable diversities of
speech found among these tribes constantly tend to disappear,
tend to range themselves under broad divisions,
coalescing into groups and families, thereby establishing
more intimate relationship between some, and widening
the distance between others. The numbers of tongues
and dialects, which at the first appeared to be legion,
by comparison and classification are constantly being reduced.
Could we go back, even for a few thousand years,
and follow these peoples through the turnings and twistings
of their nomadic existence, we should be surprised
at the rapid and complete changes constantly taking place;
we should see throughout this broad continent the tide of
human life ebbing and flowing like a mighty ocean, surging
to and fro in a perpetual unrest, huge billows of
humanity rolling over forest, plain, and mountain, nations
driving out nations, absorbing, or annihilating, only to be
themselves inevitably driven out, absorbed, or annihilated;
we should see as a result of this interminable mixture,
languages constantly being modified, some wholly or in
part disappearing, some changing in a lesser degree, hardly
one remaining the same for any considerable length of
time. Even within the short period of our own observation,
between the time of the first arrival of Europeans
and the disappearance of the natives, many changes are
apparent; while we are gazing upon them we see their
boundaries oscillate, like the play of the threads in network.
On the buffalo-hunting inland plains I have seen
aggregations of tribes driven out from their old camping-ground,
in some instances a thousand miles away, and
their places occupied by others; in the narrower limits
of the north-western mountains I have seen numerous
tribes extirpated by their neighbors, a remnant only
being kept as slaves. While such was the normal condition
of the aborigines it is not difficult to perceive in
some degree at least, the effect upon languages. Yet
while American languages are indeed, as Whitney terms
them, "the most changeful human forms of speech" there
are yet found indestructible characteristic elements, affiliations
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_555">555</a></span>
which no circumstances of time or place can
wholly obliterate.</p>

<p class="sidenote">LONG WORDS IN AMERICAN LANGUAGES.</p>

<p>One of these characteristic elements is the frequent
occurrence of long words. Even the Otomí, the only
language in America which can be called monosyllabic,
consisting as it does, for the most part, of etymons of one
syllable, contains some comparatively long words. This
frequency of long words, the method of their construction,
and the ease with which they are manufactured
constitute a striking feature in the system of unity that
pervades all American languages. The native of the
New World expresses in a single word, accompanied
perhaps by a grunt or a gesture, what a European would
employ a whole sentence to elucidate. He crowds the
greatest possible number of ideas into the most compact
form possible, as though in a multitude of words he
found weakness rather than strength&mdash;taking their several
ideas by their monosyllabic equivalents, and joining
them in one single expression. This rule is universal;
and so these languages become as Humboldt expresses
it "like different substances in analogous forms," in
which, as Gallatin observes, there is "an universal tendency
to express in the same word, not only all that
modifies or relates to the same object or action but both
the action and the object, thus concentrating in a single
expression a complex idea or several ideas, among which
there is a natural connection." This linguistic peculiarity
is called by various names. Duponceau terms it
the polysynthetic stage or system, Wilhelm von Humboldt
the agglutinative, Lieber the holophrastic; others
the aggregative, the incorporative, and so on. As an
illustration of this peculiarity, take the Aztec word for
letter-postage, <i>amatlacuilolitquitcatlaxtlahuilli</i>, which interpreted
literally signifies, 'the payment received for
carrying a paper on which something is written.' The
Cherokees go yet further and express a whole sentence
in a single word&mdash;a long one it is true, but yet
one word&mdash;<i>winitawtigeginaliskawlungtanawnelitisesti</i> which
translated forms the sentence, 'they will by that time
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_556">556</a></span>
have nearly finished granting favors from a distance to
thee and me.' Other peculiarities common to all American
languages might be mentioned, such as reduplications,
or a repetition of the same syllable to express
plurals; the use of frequentatives and duals; the application
of gender to the third person of the verb; the
direct conversion of nouns, substantive and adjective,
into verbs, and their conjugation as such; peculiar generic
distinctions arising from a separation of animate
from inanimate beings, and the like.</p>

<p>The multiplicity of tongues, even within comparatively
narrow areas, rendered the adoption of some sort
of universal language absolutely necessary. This international
language in America is for the most part
confined to gestures, and nowhere has gesture-language
attained a higher degree of perfection than here; and
what is most remarkable, the same representatives are
employed from Alaska to Mexico and even in South
America. Thus each tribe has a certain gesture to indicate
its name, which is understood by all others. A
Flathead will make his tribe known by placing his hand
upon his head; a Crow by imitating the flapping of the
wings of a bird; a Nez Percé by pointing with his finger
through his nose, and so on. Fire is generally indicated
by blowing followed by a pretended warming of the
hands, water by a pretended scooping up and drinking,
trade or exchange by crossing the fore fingers, a certain
gesture being fixed for everything necessary to carry on
a conversation. Besides this natural gesture-language
there is found in various parts an intertribal jargon
composed of words chosen to fit emergencies, from the
speech of the several neighboring nations; the words
being altered, if necessary, in construction or pronunciation
to suit all. Thus in the valley of the Yukon we find
the Slavé jargon, and in the valley of the Columbia the
Chinook jargon, which latter arose originally, not as is
generally supposed conventionally between the French-Canadian
and English trappers and the natives of the
north-west solely for purposes of trade, but which originated
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_557">557</a></span>
among the tribes themselves spontaneously and
before the advent of Europeans, though greatly modified
and extended by subsequent European intercourse.
Thus has been laid, no doubt, the foundation of many
permanent languages and dialects; and thus we may
easily perceive the powerful and continued effect of one
language upon another.</p>

<p>As to the number of languages in America much difference
of opinion exists. Hervás, before half the
country was discovered, felt justified in classifying them
all under seven families, while others find, on the Pacific
side of the northern continent alone, over six hundred
languages which thus far refuse to affiliate. The different
dialects are countless; and yet, notwithstanding the
formidable array of names which I have gathered at the
end of this chapter, probably not one-fourth of their real
number are or ever will be known to us.</p>

<p class="sidenote p2">LANGUAGES OF THE PACIFIC STATES.</p>

<p class="p2">Many of the Pacific States' languages bear resemblances
to one another, and may therefore be brought
more or less under groups and classes. These languages,
however, resemble one another too slightly to be called
dialects, and in the majority of cases no affiliations of
any kind can be traced. But four great languages are
found within our territory, or, if we exclude the Eskimo,
which is not properly an American language, there remain
but three, the Tinneh, the Aztec, and the Maya.
Of the lesser tongues there are many more, as will appear
further on. The Eskimos skirt the shores of the
north polar ocean and belong more to the old world than
to the new. The Tinneh, Athabasca, or Chepewyan family
covers the northern end of the Rocky Mountain range,
sending its branches in every direction, into Alaska,
British Columbia, British America, Washington, Oregon,
California, New Mexico, Texas, and Mexico. The Aztec
language, whose seat is Central Mexico, is found also in
Nicaragua and other parts of Central America. Traces
moreover appear in some parts of Sonora, Sinaloa,
Durango, Chihuahua, Texas, Arizona, California, Utah,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_558">558</a></span>
Nevada, Idaho, Montana, and Oregon. The Maya is the
chief Central American tongue, but traces of it may be
found as well in Mexico. Thus we see that while the
cradle of the Tinneh tongue appears to be in the centre of
British North America, its dialects extend westward and
southward, lessening in intensity the further they are removed
from the hypothetical original centre, suddenly
dying out in some directions, fading gradually away in
others, and breaking out at disconnected intervals in
others. So with the Aztec language, whose primitive
centre, so far as present appearances go, was the valley of
Mexico; we find it extending south along the shores of
the Pacific as far as Nicaragua, while northward its traces
grow fainter and fainter until it disappears. And so it
is with the Maya, which, covering as it does a less extent
of territory, is more distinctly marked and consequently
more easily followed.</p>

<p>In classifying the languages of the Pacific States,
the marks of identification vary with different families.
Thus the linguistic affiliations of the Tinneh family are
founded not so much on certain recurring grammatical
rules, as on the number of important words occurring
under the same or slightly altered form. In the Aztec
language the reverse of this is true; for although to some
extent, in the establishing of relationships, we are
governed by verbal similarities, yet we also find positive
grammatical rules which carry with them much more
weight than mere word likenesses.</p>

<p>For example, in the north, wherever Aztec traces are
found, the Aztec substantive endings <i>tl</i> and <i>tli</i> are either
abbreviated or changed according to a regular system into
<i>ti</i>, <i>te</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>de</i>, <i>re</i>, <i>ki</i>, <i>ke</i>, <i>ca</i>, <i>la</i>, <i>ri</i>. Aztec numerals are used
by these northern nations, but in greatly modified forms;
personal pronouns are there found but little changed,
while demonstrative, interrogative, and indefinite pronouns
likewise show signs of Aztec origin. The ending
<i>ame</i>, which, attached to the verb, designates the person
acting, can be plainly traced; while among these same
northern nations of which I am speaking, is found that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_559">559</a></span>
certain system of <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Lautverschiebung</i></span> or sound-shunting,
originally discovered by Grimm in the Indo-Germanic
family, and by Professor Max Müller called Grimm's
law.</p>

<p>In the pursuance of this investigation I noticed a
two-fold curiosity which may be worthy of mention.
Throughout the great Northwest, as well in most of the
many Tinneh vocabularies as elsewhere, is found the
Aztec word for stone, <i>tetl</i>, sometimes slightly changed
but always recognizable, and to which the same meaning
is invariably attached; while on the other hand the
Tinneh word for fire, <i>cun</i>, or <i>coon</i>, appears in like manner
in several of the Mexican languages, and I even noticed
it in the vocabulary of a Honduras nation. This
may be purely accidental, but both being important
words I thought best to draw attention to the fact.</p>

<p class="sidenote">INLAND AND COAST LANGUAGES.</p>

<p>The larger linguistic families are for the most part
found inland, while along the sea-shore the speech of the
people is broken into innumerable fragments. Particularly
is this the case along the shores of the Northwest.
South of Acapulco, as we have seen, the Aztec tongue
holds the seaboard for some distance; but again farther
south, as well as on the gulf coast, there is found a
great diversity in languages and dialects. In California
the confusion becomes interminable; as if Babel-builders
from every quarter of the earth had here met to the
eternal confounding of all; yet there are linguistic
families even in California, principally in the northern
part. It is not at all improbable that Malays, Chinese,
or Japanese, or all of them, did at some time appear in
what is now North America, in such numbers as materially
to influence language, but hitherto no Asiatic nor European
tongue, excepting always the Eskimo, has been found
in America; nor have affinities with any other language
of the world been discovered sufficiently marked to
warrant the claim of relationship. Theorizers enough
there have been and will be; for centuries to come half-fledged
scientists, ignorant of what others have done or
rather have failed to do, will not cease to bring forward
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_560">560</a></span>
wonderful conceptions, striking analogies; will not cease
to speculate, linguistically, ethnologically, cosmographically
and otherwise to their own satisfaction and to the
confusion of their readers. The absurdity of these speculations
is apparent to all but the speculator. No
sooner is a monosyllabic language, the Otomí, discovered
in America than up rises a champion, Señor Nájera,
claiming the distinction for the Chinese, and with no
other result than to establish both as monosyllabic, which
was well enough known before. So the Abbé Brasseur
de Bourbourg, who has given the subject more years of
study and more pages of printed matter than any other
writer, unless it be the half-crazed Lord Kingsborough,
first attempts to prove that the Maya languages are derived
from the Latin, Greek, English, German, Scandinavian,
or other Aryan tongues; then that all these
languages are but offshoots from the Maya itself, which
is the only true primeval language. So much for intemperate
speculation, which, whether learned or shallow,
too often originates in doubt and ends in obscurity. In
all these hypotheses, argument assumes the form of
analogies drawn between the peoples with whom a relationship
is attempted to be established&mdash;no difficult
matter, truly, when we consider that all mankind are
formed on one model, and that innumerable similarities
must of necessity exist among all the races of the globe.</p>

<p class="sidenote">ACCIDENTAL WORD-SIMILARITIES.</p>

<p>To show the futility of such attempts, let me give a
few words, analogous both in signification and sound,
selected from American, European, Asiatic, and other
languages, between which it is now well established that
no relationship exists. For the German <i>ja</i> we have the
Shasta <i>ya</i>; for <i>komm</i>, the Comanche <i>kim</i>; for <i>Kopf</i>, the
Cahita <i>coba</i>; for <i>weinen</i>, the Cora <i>vyeine</i>; for <i>thun</i>, the
Tepehuana <i>duni</i>; for <i>nichts</i>, <i>nein</i>, the Chinook <i>nixt</i>, <i>nix</i>.
For the Greek <span class="greek" title="korax">κόραξ</span>, there is the Tarahumara <i>colatschi</i>;
for <span class="greek" title="emathon">ἔμαθον </span>, <span class="greek" title="mathein">μαθεῖν</span>, the Cora <i>muatê</i>; for <span class="greek" title="gynê">γυνή</span>, the Cahita
<i>cuna</i>. For the Latin <i>hic</i>, <i>vas</i>, we have the Tepehuana
<i>hic</i>, <i>vase</i>; for <i>mucor</i>, the Cora <i>mucuare</i>; for <i>lingua</i>, the
Moqui <i>línga</i>; for <i>vallis</i>, the Kalapooya <i>wallâh</i>; for <i>toga</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_561">561</a></span>
<i>manus</i>, the Kenai <i>togaai</i>, <i>man</i>. For the French <i>casser</i>, we
find the Tarahumara <i>cassníaler</i>; for <i>tâtonner</i>, the Tepehuana
<i>tatame</i>. For the Spanish <i>hueco</i>, the Tarahumara
<i>hoco</i>; for <i>tuétano</i>, the Cora <i>tûtana</i>. For the Italian <i>cosi</i>,
the Tarahumara <i>cossi</i>; for the Arabic <i>âchar</i>, the Tarahumara
<i>ajaré</i>; for the Hawaiian <i>po</i>, the Sekumne <i>po</i> (night).</p>

<p>For the Sanscrit <i>da</i>, there is the Cora <i>ta</i> (give); for <i>eké</i>,
the Miztec <i>ec</i> (one); for <i>mâ</i>, the Tepehuana <i>mai</i> (not) and
the Maya <i>ma</i> (no); for <i>masâ</i> (month), the Pima <i>mahsa</i>
(moon); for <i>tschandra</i> (moon), the Kenai <i>tschane</i> (moon);
for <i>pada</i> (foot), the Sekumne <i>podo</i> (leg); for <i>kamâ</i>
(love), the Shoshone <i>kamakh</i> (to love); for <i>pâ</i>, the Kizh
<i>paa</i> (to drink). For the Malay <i>tâna</i>, we have the
Tepehuana <i>tani</i> (to ask); for <i>hurip</i>, <i>tabah</i>, the Cora <i>huri</i>
(to live), <i>tabá</i> (to beat); for <i>hômah</i>, the Shasta <i>óma</i>
(house), and so on.</p>

<p>These examples I could increase indefinitely and show
striking similarities in some few words between almost
any two languages of the world. When there are enough
of them similar in sound and signification in any two
tongues to constitute a rule rather than exceptions, such
languages are said to be related; but where, as in the
above-cited instances, these similarities are merely accidental,
to prove them related would prove too much,
for then all the languages of the earth might be said to
be related.</p>

<p class="sidenote">CLASSIFICATION OF LANGUAGES.</p>

<p>In treating of the languages of the Pacific States,
commencing with those of the north and proceeding southward,
I make it a rule to follow them wherever they
lead, without restricting myself to place or nation. One
nation may speak two languages; the same language
may be spoken by a dozen nations, and if the evidence
is such as to imply the existence of the same language,
or traces of it, in Alaska and in Sonora, I can do no
less than step from one place to the other in speaking of
it. Besides the names and localities of languages and
linguistic families, I shall endeavor to give some idea of
their several peculiar characteristics, their grammatical
construction, with such specimens of each as will enable
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_562">562</a></span>
the student to make comparisons and draw inferences.
In the following table I have attempted a classification
of these languages; but in some instances, from the lack
of vocabularies taken before the intermixtures that
followed the advent of Europeans, any classification can
be but approximative.</p>

<p>The national and tribal distinctions given in the first
volume of this work will, for the most part, serve as
divisions for languages and dialects; I shall not therefore
repeat here the names and boundaries before mentioned,
except so far as may be necessary in speaking of languages
alone. As a rule those physical and social distinctions
which indicate severalness among peoples, are
followed, if indeed they are not governed by the severalness
of dialects, that is, the diversities of language operate
as powerfully as the aspects of nature or any other causes,
in separating mankind into tribes and nations; hence it
is that in the different divisions of humanity are found
different dialects, and between dialects physical and
geographical divisions.<a id="FNanchor_IIp-1" href="#Footnote_IIp-1" class="fnanchor">[II'-1]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">LANGUAGES ON THE ARCTIC SEABOARD.</p>

<p>As I have said in another place the Eskimos are
the anomalous race of the New World; and this is no
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_575">575</a></span>
less true in their language than in their physical characteristics.
Obviously they are a polar people rather than
an American or an Asiatic people.<a id="FNanchor_IIp-2" href="#Footnote_IIp-2" class="fnanchor">[II'-2]</a> They cling to the
seaboard; and while the distinction between them and
the inland American is clearly drawn, as we descend the
strait and sea of Bering, cross the Alaskan peninsula
and follow the shores of the Pacific eastward and southward,
gradually the Arctic dialect merges into that of
the American proper. In our Hyperborean group, whose
southern bound is the fifty-fifth parallel, the northern
seaboard part is occupied wholly by Eskimos, the southern
by a people called by some Eskimos and by others Koniagas,
while further on the graduation is so complete and
the transition from one to the other so imperceptible that
it is often difficult to determine which are Indians and
which Eskimos. In treating of their manners and
customs, I separated the littoral Alaskans into two divisions,
calling them Eskimos and Koniagas, but in their
languages and dialects I shall speak of them as one.
No philologist familiar with the whole territory has
attempted to classify these Hyperborean tongues; different
writers refer the languages of all to such particular
parts as they happen to be familiar with. Thus the
Russian priest Veniaminoff divides the Eskimo language
into six dialects, all belonging to the Koniagas, on the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_576">576</a></span>
Kadiak Islands and the adjacent territory. The fact
is Veniaminoff dwelt in southern Alaska and in the
Aleutian Isles, and knew nothing of the great inland
nations to the north and west. To the people of Kadiak
he gives two dialects, a northern and a southern, and
carries the same language over to the main land adjacent.<a id="FNanchor_IIp-3" href="#Footnote_IIp-3" class="fnanchor">[II'-3]</a>
The Russian explorer Sagoskin, to the Chnagmute
dialect of Veniaminoff, unites the Kwichpagmute and
Kuskoquigmute under the collective name of Kangjulit,
of which with the Kadiak he makes a comparative vocabulary
establishing their identity.<a id="FNanchor_IIp-4" href="#Footnote_IIp-4" class="fnanchor">[II'-4]</a> In like manner Baer
classifies these northern languages, but confines himself
almost exclusively to the coast above Kadiak Island.<a id="FNanchor_IIp-5" href="#Footnote_IIp-5" class="fnanchor">[II'-5]</a></p>

<p>Kotzebue says that a dialect of this same language is
spoken by the natives of St Lawrence Island.<a id="FNanchor_IIp-6" href="#Footnote_IIp-6" class="fnanchor">[II'-6]</a> Yet if
we may believe Mr Seemann, all these dialects are essentially
different. The Eskimo language, he writes, "is
divided into many dialects, which often vary so much
that those who speak one are unable to understand the
others. The natives of Kotzebue Sound for instance
have to use an interpreter in conversing with their
countrymen in Norton Sound; towards Point Barrow
another dialect prevails, which however is not sufficiently
distinct to be unintelligible to the Kotzebue people."<a id="FNanchor_IIp-7" href="#Footnote_IIp-7" class="fnanchor">[II'-7]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">EXAMPLES OF THE ESKIMO GRAMMAR.</p>

<p>According to Vater and Richardson the Eskimo
language as spoken east of the Mackenzie River appears
to have a softer sound, as for instance, for the western
ending <i>tch</i> the eastern tribes mostly use <i>s</i> and sometimes
<i>h</i>. The German sound <i>ch</i>, guttural, is frequently
heard among the western people. Nouns have six cases,
the changes of which are expressed by affixed syllables.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_577">577</a></span></p>

<p>These are in the singular <i>mut</i>, <i>mik</i>, <i>mit</i>, <i>me</i>, and <i>kut</i>, and
in the plural <i>nut</i>, <i>nik</i>, <i>nit</i>, <i>ne</i>, and <i>gut</i>. <i>Ga</i>, <i>go</i>, <i>ne</i>, <i>ait</i>,
<i>anga</i>, <i>ara</i>, etc., affixed to the nominative, denote a possessive
case. As:&mdash;<i>kivgah</i>, a servant; <i>kivganga</i>, my
servant; <i>kivgane</i>, his servant; etc. <i>Arsu</i> and <i>arsuit</i> are
diminutive endings and <i>soak</i>, <i>sudset</i>, and <i>sudsek</i> augmentatives.
Adjectives are also declinable. Nouns can be
transposed into verbs by affixing <i>evok</i> and <i>ovok</i>, and the
adjective is altered in the same manner.</p>

<p>The third person singular of the indicative is taken
as the root of the verb, and by changing its termination
it may be used as a noun. The infinitive is formed by
the postposition <i>nek</i>. The verb has numerous inflections.</p>

<p>'To be' or 'to have,' both possessing a similar signification,
are expressed by <i>gi</i> or <i>vi</i>&mdash;as <i>nunagiva</i>, it is his
land.</p>

<p>Richardson gives the following declension of a noun,
transitively and intransitively (?):</p>

<p>Some claim that the languages of Kadiak and the
Aleutian Islands are cognate, others deny any relationship.
Stephen Glottoff, one of the first to visit Kadiak
Island, states positively that the inhabitants of Unalaska
and particularly a boy from the western Aleutian Isles
could not understand the people of Kadiak.<a id="FNanchor_IIp-9" href="#Footnote_IIp-9" class="fnanchor">[II'-9]</a> Captain
Cook thought there existed a phonetic similarity between
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_578">578</a></span>
the speech of the Unalaskas and the people of Norton
Sound, which opinion appears to be correct.<a id="FNanchor_IIp-10" href="#Footnote_IIp-10" class="fnanchor">[II'-10]</a> So
disarranged have the aboriginal tongues in this vicinity
become since the advent of the Russians that little dependence
can be placed on latter-day investigations.
Dall admits the speech of the two peoples to be dissimilar
yet their language he believes to be one.<a id="FNanchor_IIp-11" href="#Footnote_IIp-11" class="fnanchor">[II'-11]</a> Vater, more
cautious, thinks that there is perhaps some Eskimo influence
noticeable among the Koniagas.<a id="FNanchor_IIp-12" href="#Footnote_IIp-12" class="fnanchor">[II'-12]</a> Baer gives
Admiral von Wrangell's opinion, which also inclines
towards such a connection, but he himself expresses the
opposite belief, citing in support of this that the physical
appearance of the Koniagas differs entirely from that of
the Eskimo race.<a id="FNanchor_IIp-13" href="#Footnote_IIp-13" class="fnanchor">[II'-13]</a> Buschmann gives, as the result of
careful investigations and comparisons, the opinion that
the language of Unalaska is distinct from that of Kadiak,
and supports it by the statements of travelers, as
for instance that of the mate Saikoff, given in the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Neue
Nordische Beiträge</i>, tom. iii., p. 284,</span> who says that the
two are totally different.</p>

<p class="sidenote">ATKHA AND UNALASKA DIALECTS.</p>

<p>Throughout the whole Aleutian Archipelago there are
but two dialects, one of which is spoken on the peninsula,
on Unalaska, and a few islands contiguous, while the
other&mdash;by Veniaminoff called the Atkha dialect&mdash;extends
thence over all the other Aleutian Isles. In neither
dialect is there any distinction of gender; but to make
up for this deficiency, besides the plural, a dual is
used. Substantives have three cases:&mdash;<i>adakch</i>, the father;
<i>adam</i> or <i>adaganilyak</i>, of the father; <i>adaman</i>, to the father;
<i>adakik</i> or <i>adakin</i>, both fathers; <i>adan</i>, the fathers; <i>adanik</i>,
to the fathers. Verbs are conjugated by means of terminals.
They are divided into three classes, active,
medium, and passive. Negation is expressed by the syllable
<i>oljuk</i> added to the root of the verb; sometimes also by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_579">579</a></span>
<i>ljaka</i>, <i>ljaga</i>, or <i>gana</i>. <i>Sjukong</i>, I take; <i>sjunakching</i>, I took;
<i>sjuljakakching</i>, I take not; <i>sjunag´oljuting</i>, I took not;
<i>sjuda</i>, take; <i>sjuljagada</i>, or <i>sjuganachtchin</i>, take not.</p>

<p>The eastern Aleuts enunciate very rapidly, without
dividing their words distinctly, making it very difficult
for a stranger to understand them. In Unalaska their
speech is more drawling, while on Atkha Island the
natives pronounce each word very distinctly. The
western Aleuts and the people on Umnak also speak
rather slowly&mdash;drawling.<a id="FNanchor_IIp-14" href="#Footnote_IIp-14" class="fnanchor">[II'-14]</a> Dall states that the chief
difference between the Atkha and Unalaska dialects
consists in the formation of the plural of nouns. The
former for this purpose employ the terminal letters <i>s</i>,
<i>sh</i>, or <i>ng</i>. For diminutives the Atkhas use the ending
<i>kutshak</i> and the Unalaskas <i>dak</i>.<a id="FNanchor_IIp-15" href="#Footnote_IIp-15" class="fnanchor">[II'-15]</a></p>

speaking this language are the Chilkats, Sitkas, Hoodsinoos,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_580"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_581">581</a></span>
barbarous speech found anywhere in the Pacific States.
Whether this arises from the huge block of wood with
which the Thlinkeet matrons grace their under lip,
which drives the sound from the throat through the
teeth and nose before it reaches the ear of the listener, I
do not pretend to say; but that it is hard, guttural,
clucking, hissing, in short everything but labial, there is
no doubt. All who have visited them, whether German,
English, French, or Spanish, agree in this particular.
Marchand describes it as excessively rude and wild.
Most of their articulations are accompanied by a
strong nasal aspiration, with strenuous efforts of the
throat; particularly in producing the sound of a double
<i>r</i>, which is heavy and hard. Many of their words commence
with a strongly guttural <i>k</i> sound and this same
sound is frequently heard three times in one word. Dr
Roblet who accompanied Marchand, says that, notwithstanding
all this, the language is very complete, possessing
a multitude of words, the natives being at no loss to
give a name to everything.<a id="FNanchor_IIp-21" href="#Footnote_IIp-21" class="fnanchor">[II'-21]</a> La Pérouse, who makes a
similar report, gives as an example of its harshness the
word <i>khlrleies</i>, hair.<a id="FNanchor_IIp-22" href="#Footnote_IIp-22" class="fnanchor">[II'-22]</a> In Veniaminoff's vocabulary are
found such words as <i>thlklunúk</i>, healthy, and <i>katlhth</i>, ashes,
literally unpronounceable. The frequently occurring
sound <i>tl</i> has led several authors to suppose a relationship
with the Aztec tongue; as for example Vater, who made
a small comparative table which I insert to show directly
the contrary to what he wished to prove.</p>

<p>Setting aside the <i>tetl</i>, <i>te</i>, stone, of which I have made
previous mention, had the words been selected to prove
a want of affinity between the two languages they could
not have been more to the point. Buschmann asserts,
moreover, that several of the Mexican words are mis-quoted.<a id="FNanchor_IIp-23" href="#Footnote_IIp-23" class="fnanchor">[II'-23]</a></p>

<p>A few instances have been discovered by the
same writer, where the Thlinkeet tongue appears to be
verging towards the Tinneh. Among others he mentions
the Thlinkeet words <i>te</i>, stone, <i>zyyn</i>, muskrat, comparing the
latter with the Dogrib <i>tzin</i>; the Thlinkeet <i>achschat</i>,
woman, wife, with the Umpqua <i>sch'at</i>; the Thlinkeet <i>tjé</i>,
<i>teik</i>, road, with the Tacully <i>tee</i>.<a id="FNanchor_IIp-25" href="#Footnote_IIp-25" class="fnanchor">[II'-25]</a> La Pérouse pretends
that they do not use and can hardly pronounce the
letters <i>b</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>j</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>p</i>, and <i>v</i>. Most words commence with
<i>k</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>s</i>, or <i>m</i>, the first named being the most frequently
used; no word commences with an <i>r</i>.<a id="FNanchor_IIp-26" href="#Footnote_IIp-26" class="fnanchor">[II'-26]</a> Veniaminoff
again says that it would take thirty-eight letters or combinations
to write the distinct sounds which are expressed
in the Thlinkeet language. The personal pronouns are
<i>khat</i>, or <i>khatsh</i>, I; <i>bae</i>, <i>be</i>, or <i>belch</i>, thou; <i>b</i> or <i>bch</i>, he; <i>ban</i>
or <i>bantch</i>, we; <i>iban</i> or <i>ibantch</i>, you; <i>as</i> or <i>astch</i> or <i>youtas</i>
or <i>youastch</i>, they. The verb 'to do' is conjugated as
follows:</p>

<p>Next come the Tinneh, a people whose diffusion is
only equaled by that of the Aryan or Semitic nations
of the old world. The dialects of the Tinneh language
are by no means confined within the limits of the Hyperborean
division. Stretching from the northern interior
of Alaska down into Sonora and Chihuahua, we
have here a linguistic line of more than four thousand
miles in length extending diagonally over forty-two
degrees of latitude; like a great tree whose trunk is the
Rocky Mountain range, whose roots encompass the
deserts of Arizona and New Mexico, and whose branches
touch the borders of Hudson Bay<a id="FNanchor_IIp-29" href="#Footnote_IIp-29" class="fnanchor">[II'-29]</a> and of the Arctic
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_584">584</a></span>
and Pacific oceans.<a id="FNanchor_IIp-30" href="#Footnote_IIp-30" class="fnanchor">[II'-30]</a> In the north, immense compact
areas are covered by these dialects; towards the south
the line holds its course steadily in one direction, while
at the same time on either side are isolated spots, broken
fragments as it were, of the Tinneh tongue, at wide distances
in some cases from the central line. A reference
to the classification given at the end of the preceding
chapter, will show the separation of the Tinneh
family into four divisions&mdash;the eastern, western, central
and southern. The eastern division embraces the dialects
spoken between Hudson Bay and the Mackenzie
River; the western, those of the Kutchins and Kenai of
interior Alaska and the Pacific Coast in the vicinity of
Mount St Elias and Copper River; the central, those of
the Tacullies of New Caledonia, the Umpquas of Oregon,
and the Hoopahs of California; the southern, those of
the Apaches of New Mexico, Arizona, and Northern
Mexico.</p>

<p>Near the sources of a branch of the Saskatchewan
River are the Sursees, who have been frequently classed
with the Blackfeet, but Mackenzie had before this stated
that they speak a dialect of the Tinneh.<a id="FNanchor_IIp-31" href="#Footnote_IIp-31" class="fnanchor">[II'-31]</a> Umfreville
who visited these people, compares their language to the
cackling of hens, and says that it is very difficult for their
neighbors to learn it.<a id="FNanchor_IIp-32" href="#Footnote_IIp-32" class="fnanchor">[II'-32]</a></p>

<p>Glance first at the dialects round Hudson Bay, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_585">585</a></span>
thence towards the west. The northern dialects are exceedingly
difficult to pronounce, being composed largely
of gutturals. Richardson compares some of the sounds
to the Hottentot cluck, and Isbister calls them "harsh
and guttural, difficult of enunciation and unpleasant to
the ear."<a id="FNanchor_IIp-33" href="#Footnote_IIp-33" class="fnanchor">[II'-33]</a> They differ mainly in accentuation and
pronunciation, and it therefore does not require that
philological research which is necessary with the farther
outlying branches of the family to establish their connection.
Richardson says that the Hare and Dog-rib
dialects differ scarcely at all even in their accents; and
again that the Sheep dialect is well understood by the
Hare Indians. Latham affirms that the "Beaver Indian
is transitional to the Slavé and Chepewyan proper."
Of the Coppermine people, Franklin writes that their
language is "essentially the same with those of the
Chipewyans." Ross Cox says that the language of the
Slowacuss and Nascud "bears a close affinity to that
spoken by the Chepewyans and Beaver Indians."<a id="FNanchor_IIp-34" href="#Footnote_IIp-34" class="fnanchor">[II'-34]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">DIALECTS OF THE TINNEH FAMILY.</p>

<p>From a paper in the collection of M. Du Ponceau,
cited by Mr Gallatin, there appears to be in the grammar
of these northern dialects a dual as well as a plural.
Thus <i>dinné</i>, a person; <i>dinné you</i>, a man; <i>dinné you keh</i>,
two men; <i>dinné you thlang</i>, many men. Again we have
<i>sick keh</i>, my foot; <i>sick keh keh</i>, my feet. The Chepewyan
declension is as follows:</p>

<p>My two hats, <i>sit sackhallé keh</i>; thy two hats, <i>nit
sackhallé keh</i>; his two hats, <i>bit sackhaleé keh</i>, or <i>noneh bid
tsakhalle keh</i>; their two hats, <i>hoot sackhallé keh</i>; two
pieces of wood, <i>teitchin keh</i>; much, or many pieces of
wood, <i>teitchin thlang</i>; my son, <i>see azé</i>; my two sons, <i>see
azé keh</i>; thy two sons, <i>nee azé keh</i>; his two sons, <i>bee
azé keh</i>; their two sons, <i>hoo bee azé keh</i>; my children,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_586">586</a></span>
<i>see azé keh thlang</i>, or <i>siskainé</i>. Thus we see that the
dual ending is <i>keh</i> (which also means foot), and that of
the plural, <i>thlang</i>. Possessive pronouns are: first person,
<i>si</i>, <i>sit</i> or <i>nee</i>; second person, <i>nit</i> or <i>nee</i>; third person,
his or their, <i>bit</i>, <i>bee</i>, <i>noot</i>, or <i>hoo</i>.</p>

<p>At the end of this chapter may be found a comparative
vocabulary, comprising words selected from these
and other dialects, belonging to this family.</p>

<p class="sidenote">THE KUTCHIN DIALECTS OF THE YUKON.</p>

<p>Crossing over to the country drained by the Yukon,
we find the great Kutchin nation and to their north-east
the Kenai. The Kutchins, according to Jones, are
"divided into about twenty-two different tribes, each
speaking a dialect of the same language." Hardisty
affirms that "the Loucheux proper is spoken by the
Indians of Peels River, thence traversing the mountains,
westward down Rat River, the Tuk-kuth, and Van-tah-koo-chin,
which extend to the Tran-jik-koo-chin, Na-tsik-koo-chin,
and Koo-cha-koo-chin of the Youcon."<a id="FNanchor_IIp-36" href="#Footnote_IIp-36" class="fnanchor">[II'-36]</a>
The connection of the Kutchin language with the Tinneh
has been, by early travelers, denied, and this denial re-echoed
by writers following them;<a id="FNanchor_IIp-37" href="#Footnote_IIp-37" class="fnanchor">[II'-37]</a> but later philological
investigations have established the relationship beyond a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_587">587</a></span>
question. Furthermore, to corroborate this fact there
are persons, well acquainted with these people and their
language, having lived in their country and traded with
them for years, who are positive that the Kutchin is a
dialect of the Tinneh. Some of them even affirm that
the eastern Kutchin dialect bears a closer relationship
to that of their neighbors, the Hares and Slavés, than do
some of the dialects of the western Kutchins to each
other, yet it is certain that all the Kutchin tribes of the
Yukon and its tributaries understand one another, accentuation
being the principal distinction between them.</p>

<p>A greater divergence from the stock language is
observable in the dialect of the Tutchone Kutchin, which,
with those of the Han Kutchin, the Slavé of Francis
Lake and Fort Halkett, the Sicannis, the Abbato-tinneh
of the Pelly and Macmillan Rivers, and the Nehanne
of forts Liard and Simpson, might almost be called a
dialectic division of the Tinneh language.<a id="FNanchor_IIp-38" href="#Footnote_IIp-38" class="fnanchor">[II'-38]</a></p>

<p>Richardson, following Murray, cautiously traces these
relationships in the following words: "More resemblances,
he thinks, might be traced through the Mountain
Indian speech (Naha-'tdinnè or Dtchè-ta-ut'tinnè) than
directly between the Kutchin and Dog-rib tongues. The
Han-Kutchi of the sources of the Yukon, speak a dialect
of the Kutcha-Kutchi language, yet they understand and
are readily understood by the Indians of Frances Lake
and the banks of the Pelly. Now these converse freely
with the Naha- or Dtché-ta-ut'tinnè, and other Rocky
Mountain tribes, whose language resembles the Dog-rib
tongue, and who are, in fact, acknowledged members of
the Chepewyan nation. Again, the Frances Lake Indians
understand the Netsilley, or Wild Nation, who
trade at Fort Halkett, on the River of the Mountains;
these again are understood by the Sikanis; and the Sikanis
by the Beaver Indians, whose dialect varies little
from that of the Athabascans, the longest-known member
of the 'Tinnè nation."<a id="FNanchor_IIp-39" href="#Footnote_IIp-39" class="fnanchor">[II'-39]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_588">588</a></span></p>

<p>The Kutchins pride themselves on their oratorical
powers, making long, windy, and allegorical speeches remarkable
alike for native wit and eloquence. In
public speaking their delivery is unique and effective;
commencing in a low monotonous tone the voice slowly
rises to a crescendo, then increases to a forte, and
finally rolls forth in grand fortissimo, at which point,
accompanied by striking gestures, it continues until sheer
exhaustion compels the orator to pause for breath. The
speech closes with a "most infernal screech," as Hardisty
calls it, which is supposed to be a clincher to the
most abstruse argument.</p>

<p>It was among these people, in the vicinity of the junction
of the Tananah with the Yukon River that the
before-mentioned broken Slavé jargon originated. Before
the arrival of foreigners, the necessity of a trade, or
intertribal, language was felt and met, the dialect spoken
on the Liard River forming the basis. With the arrival
of Russians, French, and English successively, each one
of these nationalities contributed of its words to form the
general jargon. Dall says that it is in use among all
western Eskimos who have intercourse with the Tinneh.
The European element in their jargon is very slight,
much less than in the Chinook jargon, from the fact that
but few Europeans have ever come in contact with the
inland tribes of Alaska even in an indirect way.</p>

<p>Following the Tinneh tongue southward from Central
Alaska, we strike the Pacific seaboard at Cook's Inlet
and Prince William Sound, where we find the Kenai,
with six or more dialects, stretching along the shores of
the Ocean as far as Copper River. The word Kenai, or
as they are sometimes called the Thnaina,<a id="FNanchor_IIp-40" href="#Footnote_IIp-40" class="fnanchor">[II'-40]</a> meaning
men, in signification and sound is almost identical with
the word Tinneh, Dinneh, Tinné, Dinay, Tinna, with
many other variations applied to this family.<a id="FNanchor_IIp-41" href="#Footnote_IIp-41" class="fnanchor">[II'-41]</a> According
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_589">589</a></span>
to Sagoskin the Ingaliks, Unakatanas, and others
of the Yukon and Nulato rivers call themselves Ttynaichotana.<a id="FNanchor_IIp-42" href="#Footnote_IIp-42" class="fnanchor">[II'-42]</a>
Veniaminoff, a high authority on matters
coming under his immediate observation, draws erroneous
conclusions from his comparisons of Kenai dialects.
The Kenai language, he says, is divided into four dialects;
the Kenai proper, the Atnah spoken by the Koltshanes
and the people of Copper River, the Kuskoquim, and the
Kwichpak.<a id="FNanchor_IIp-43" href="#Footnote_IIp-43" class="fnanchor">[II'-43]</a> Baron von Wrangell is of the opinion that
the Kenai are of Thlinkeet stock, affirming that although
their idiom is different yet it comes from the same root;<a id="FNanchor_IIp-44" href="#Footnote_IIp-44" class="fnanchor">[II'-44]</a>
but Dall believes that it might be "more properly
grouped with the Tinneh."<a id="FNanchor_IIp-45" href="#Footnote_IIp-45" class="fnanchor">[II'-45]</a> The dialect of the Ugalenzes,
Buschmann confidently asserts, belongs to the
Tinneh family, although its connection with the Kenai
is not strongly marked, while slight traces of the Thlinkeet
tongue are found in it, but not the least shadow of
the Aztec as Vater imagined.<a id="FNanchor_IIp-46" href="#Footnote_IIp-46" class="fnanchor">[II'-46]</a> Long words are of frequent
occurrence in the speech of the Ugalenzes; as
for example, <i>chakljtschejalsga</i>, work; <i>tekssekonachalek</i>,
enemy; <i>kakujasliatenna</i>, to divide; <i>aukatschetohatle</i>, to
take away.</p>

<p class="sidenote p2">KENAI LINGUISTIC AFFILIATIONS.</p>

<p class="p2">The Atnah dialect has also been classed with the
Thlinkeet by Baer, who inserts a small comparative
vocabulary to show the similarity, but in it few similar
words are found, while between the Atnah and the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_590">590</a></span>

instance;</p>

<p>In like manner the Kenai dialect has been classed
with the Thlinkeet;<a id="FNanchor_IIp-48" href="#Footnote_IIp-48" class="fnanchor">[II'-48]</a> but here the preponderance of
evidence is with the Tinneh. Buschmann claims it
as his discovery that the Kenai belong to the Tinneh
family.<a id="FNanchor_IIp-49" href="#Footnote_IIp-49" class="fnanchor">[II'-49]</a> The Kenai dialect is very difficult to pronounce,
so much so that even the neighboring people with their
harsh, nasal, and guttural idioms, find great trouble in
enunciating it clearly. Some of the combinations of
consonants are really very curious,<a id="FNanchor_IIp-50" href="#Footnote_IIp-50" class="fnanchor">[II'-50]</a>&mdash;<i>aljtnjan</i>, earth;
<i>kyssynj</i>, woman; <i>mljchny</i>, to drink; <i>keljkatj</i>, to eat;
<i>ktaaltatlni</i>, to shoot; <i>kydykntjassnissj</i>, I hear; <i>tschatscheeintschichku</i>,
do not be afraid; <i>kazikatejityssny</i>, I know not.</p>

<p>Baer makes the Ingalik cognate with Kenai, Atnah,
and Thlinkeet;<a id="FNanchor_IIp-51" href="#Footnote_IIp-51" class="fnanchor">[II'-51]</a> an affinity is also detected between the
Inkalit and the Kenai, Atnah, and Unalaska dialects;<a id="FNanchor_IIp-52" href="#Footnote_IIp-52" class="fnanchor">[II'-52]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_591">591</a></span>
while Sagoskin numbers both the Ingalik and the Inkalit
among the members of the Tinneh family.<a id="FNanchor_IIp-53" href="#Footnote_IIp-53" class="fnanchor">[II'-53]</a> Like
those of their neighbors these two dialects are harsh and
difficult of pronunciation, as for instance in the Inkalit,
<i>tschugljkchuja</i>, a fox.</p>

<p>From the earliest times it has been known that the
Koltshanes could converse freely with the Atnahs and
Kenai, and the relationship existing between these dialects
has long been recognized.<a id="FNanchor_IIp-54" href="#Footnote_IIp-54" class="fnanchor">[II'-54]</a> As a specimen of the
Koltshane tongue, I present the following: <i>tschiljkaje</i>,
eagle; <i>nynkakit</i>, earth; <i>ssyljtschitan</i>, cold; <i>sstscheljssilj</i>,
warm; <i>tschilje</i>, man.</p>

<p class="sidenote">CENTRAL TINNEH DIVISION.</p>

<p>To the Tacullies of our central Tinneh division, whose
language Hale separates into eleven dialects, Latham
adds the Sicannis, and other writers the Umpquas and
the Hoopahs.<a id="FNanchor_IIp-55" href="#Footnote_IIp-55" class="fnanchor">[II'-55]</a> The northern dialects of this division are
represented as composed of words harsh and difficult to
pronounce, while the southern dialects are softer and
more sonorous, yet robust and emphatic. Mr Hale felt
the necessity of adopting a peculiar style of orthography
to represent the sounds of these words. The Greek
<i>chi</i> he employed to reproduce the Tacully gutturals,
which he says are somewhat deeper than the Spanish
<span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><i>jota</i></span>, probably nearly akin to the German <i>ch</i> in <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>acht und
achtzig</i></span>. With <i>t chi l</i> he aims to convey a sound which "is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_592">592</a></span>
a combination uttered by forcing out the breath at the
side of the mouth between the tongue and the palate."<a id="FNanchor_IIp-56" href="#Footnote_IIp-56" class="fnanchor">[II'-56]</a>
In the following words instead of the Greek <i>chi</i>, I write
<i>kh</i>, and for <i>t chi l</i>, <i>sch</i>. <i>Schling</i>, dog; <i>schluk</i>, fish; <i>sutschon</i>,
good; <i>kwun</i>, fire; <i>kukh</i>, house; <i>schhell</i>, mountain; <i>tse</i>,
stone; <i>kuschkai</i>, run.</p>

<p>Hale is the only author who gives any information of
the two tribes Tlatskanai and Kwalhioqua. The Kwalhioquas
dwell on the north bank of the Columbia, near
its mouth; but between them and the river there runs a
wedge of Chinook territory. The former are to be found
south of the river, on a narrow strip extending north
and south. Being nearly related to the Tacully, these
languages also belong to the Tinneh family. The only
vocabulary obtainable is given by Mr Hale. Round the
headwaters of the river Umpqua live the people of that
name, speaking a language related to the two last mentioned,
but which, if we may believe Mr Hale, is "much
softer than the others."</p>

<p class="sidenote">VOCABULARY OF HOOPAH DIALECTS.</p>

<p>Scouler, who has made a curious classification of the
languages of north-western America, places the Umpqua in
the same family with the Calapooya and Yamkally under
the general name of Cathlascon.<a id="FNanchor_IIp-57" href="#Footnote_IIp-57" class="fnanchor">[II'-57]</a> The southernmost
dialect of this division is that of the Hoopahs, on Trinity
River. Upon the authority of Mr Powers, "the Hoopa
language is worthy of the people who speak it&mdash;copious
in its vocabulary; robust, sonorous, and strong in utterance;
of a martial simplicity and rudeness in construction."
Again he writes, "as the Hoopas remind
one of the Romans among savages, so is their language
something akin to the Latin in its phonetic characteristics:
the idiom of camps&mdash;rude, strong, laconic. Let a
grave and decorous Indian speak it deliberately, and
every word comes out like the thud of a battering-ram
against a wall. For instance let the reader take the
words for 'devil' and 'death'&mdash;<i>keetoanchwa</i> and <i>cheechwit</i>&mdash;and
note the robust strength with which they can be
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_593">593</a></span>
uttered. What a grand roll of drums there is in that
long, strong word, <i>conchwilchwil</i>." Mr Powers gives
the following declension: I, <i>hwe</i>; father, <i>hoota</i>; my

<p>On the western slope of Mount Shasta, there is the
Wi-Lackee language, which bears a close likeness to the
Hoopah; on Mad River is the Lassic and on Eel River
the Siah, both probably Hoopah dialects, and on Smith
River in Del Norte County, the Haynaggi, Tolewah and
Tahahteen, also presumably Hoopah and Wi-Lackee dialects.
The following comparative table of the numerals
in the Tolewah, Hoopah, and Wi-Lackee dialects, will
serve to illustrate their relationship.</p>

<p class="sidenote">SPEECH OF THE APACHE TRIBES.</p>

<p>In the southern and last division of the Tinneh family
are found the great Apache and Navajo nations, with
their many dialects. The Apaches may be said to inhabit
or rather to roam over the country, commencing
at the Colorado desert and extending east to the Rio
Pecos, or from about 103° to 114° west long., and from
Utah Territory into the states of Sonora, Chihuahua,
Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, and Texas, or from about 38° to
30° north lat. Hardly two authors agree in stating the
number and names of the different tribes belonging to
this nation.<a id="FNanchor_IIp-59" href="#Footnote_IIp-59" class="fnanchor">[II'-59]</a> The names by which they are known
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_594">594</a></span>
among themselves are, according to Orozco y Berra:
<i>Vinni ettinen-ne</i>, <i>Segatajen-ne</i>, <i>Tjuiccujen-ne</i>, <i>Iccujen-ne</i>,
<i>Yutajen-ne</i>, <i>Sejen-ne</i>, <i>Cuelcajen-ne</i>, <i>Lipajen-ne</i>, for which
the Mexicans have substituted, such words as Apaches,
Tontos, Chiricaguis, Gileños, Mimbreños, Faraones,
Mescaleros, Llaneros, Lipanes, and Navajos.<a id="FNanchor_IIp-60" href="#Footnote_IIp-60" class="fnanchor">[II'-60]</a> The nations
that make up this great people are the Chiricaguis
in north-eastern Sonora; Coyoteros in the Gila country;
Faraones, west of New Mexico in the Sierras del Diablo,
Chanate, and Pilares; Gileños at the eastern base of the
Sierra de los Mimbres south of the Rio Gila; the people
of the copper mines on both banks of the Rio Grande,
ranging west to the Coyoteros and Pinaleños, and also
into Chihuahua and Sonora, and at Lake Guzman west
of Paso del Norte; the Lipanes, or Ipandes, in Texas;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_595">595</a></span>
the Llaneros, north-east of Santa Fé, and northerly of
the Rio Rojo de Natchitoches or Rio Pecos; Mescaleros,
in the Sierras del Diablo, Chanate, Pilares, and on
both banks of the Rio Tuerco, above its confluence with
the Rio Grande; the Natages, or Natajes, in Texas near
the Lipanes; the Pelones, in Coahuila; the Pinaleños,
in the Sierras del Pinal and Blanca; the Tejuas, east
of the Rio Grande, in the Gila country; the Tontos, in
north-eastern Sonora, in the north-east near the Seris in
the Pimeria Alta, and south of the Maricopas and
the Rio Gila; the Vaqueros in the eastern part of New
Mexico; the Mimbreños, in the Sierra de los Mimbres,
west of Paso del Norte, and in the south-western end of
New Mexico, on the northern boundary of Chihuahua.<a id="FNanchor_IIp-61" href="#Footnote_IIp-61" class="fnanchor">[II'-61]</a>
The Xicarillas, whose dialect forms the principal connecting
link between the Apache language and the
Tinneh family, live on the Rio de los Osos, west of the
Rio Grande; also in the Moro Mountains and along the
Cimarron.<a id="FNanchor_IIp-62" href="#Footnote_IIp-62" class="fnanchor">[II'-62]</a> All the Apache tribes speak dialects but
slightly varying from one another, and all can converse
easily together. Different accentuations and some peculiar
vocal appellations are, for the most part, all that
constitute severalness in these dialects. Don José Cortéz
states that "the utterance of the language is very violent,
but it is not so difficult to speak as the first impression
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_596">596</a></span>
of it would lead one to suppose; for the ear, becoming
accustomed to the sound, discovers a cadence in the
words." "It has great poverty, both of expression and
words." It appears as well that the harsh gutturals so
constantly heard among the northern members of the
Tinneh family, frequently occur in the Apache dialects.<a id="FNanchor_IIp-63" href="#Footnote_IIp-63" class="fnanchor">[II'-63]</a>
Bartlett writes, "it sounds like a combination of Polish,
Chinese, Choctaw, and Dutch. Grunts and gutturals
abound, and there is a strong resemblance to the Hottentot
click. Now blend these together, and as you
utter the word, swallow it, and the sound will be a fair
specimen of an Apache word."<a id="FNanchor_IIp-64" href="#Footnote_IIp-64" class="fnanchor">[II'-64]</a> Apache affiliations
have been surmised by different writers, with nearly all
their neighbors, and even with more distant nations.
Arricivita hints at a possible relationship with the Otomí,
because an Otomí muleteer told him that he could converse
with the Apaches.<a id="FNanchor_IIp-65" href="#Footnote_IIp-65" class="fnanchor">[II'-65]</a> The Shoshone and Comanche
dialects have also been referred to the Tinneh trunk, but
in reality they belong to the Sonora vernacular, a discovery
first made by Turner, and proved by Buschmann.</p>

<p class="sidenote">APACHE GRAMMAR.</p>

<p>Col. Cremony, who was interpreter for the United
States Mexican boundary commission, and hence conversant
with the Apache language, gives some valuable
grammatical notes. "Their verbs," he says "express the
past, present and future with much regularity, and have
the infinitive, indicative, subjunctive and imperative
moods, together with the first, second and third persons,
and the singular, dual and plural numbers. Many of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_597">597</a></span>
them are very irregular, and depend upon auxiliaries
which are few. In all that relates to special individuality
the language is exacting; thus, <i>shee</i> means I, or me;
but <i>shee-dah</i> means I myself, or me myself; <i>dee</i> means
thee or thou; but <i>dee-dah</i> means you yourself especially
and personally, without reference to any other being.
When an Apache is relating his own personal adventures
he never says <i>shee</i> for I, because that word, in some
sense, includes all who were present and took any part
in the affair but he uses the word <i>shee-dah</i>, to show that the
act was wholly his own. The pronouns are: <i>shee</i>&mdash;I;
<i>shee-dah</i>&mdash;I myself; <i>dee</i>&mdash;thee or thou; <i>dee-dah</i>, thee
thyself; <i>aghan</i>&mdash;it, he, her, or they. The word <i>to-dah</i>
means no, and all their affirmatives are negatived by
dividing this word so as to place the first syllable in
front and the second in the rear of the verb to be negatived.
For example, <i>ink-tah</i> means, sit down, but to
say, do <i>not</i> sit down, we must express it <i>to-ink-tah-dah</i>;
<i>nuest-chee-shee</i>, come here; <i>to-nuest-chee-shee-dah</i>, do <i>not</i>
come here; <i>anah-zont-tee</i>, begone; <i>to-anah-zont-tee-dah</i>, do
<i>not</i> begone."<a id="FNanchor_IIp-66" href="#Footnote_IIp-66" class="fnanchor">[II'-66]</a></p>

<p>Mr Dorr, writing in the <i>Overland Monthly</i>, makes an
erroneous assertion that the Apache and Zuñi languages
are the same, "differing only in accent, intonation, and
cadence, they understand each other without difficulty.
The Zuñi, or Apache language is very flexible and
<i>suave</i>, and may at some time have been the Court language
of the ancient races. It is often as expressive of
fine shades of distinction as even the Greek itself. It
preserves&mdash;in the <i>adyta</i> of its wonderful radicals&mdash;the
traditional duality of the human race: its dual, as well
as singular and plural, forms of speech."<a id="FNanchor_IIp-68" href="#Footnote_IIp-68" class="fnanchor">[II'-68]</a></p>

<p>Vater intimates a relationship between the Apaches
and the Pawnees, and that chiefly on the ground of a
similarity in the names Pawnees and Lipanes.<a id="FNanchor_IIp-69" href="#Footnote_IIp-69" class="fnanchor">[II'-69]</a></p>

<p>Pimentel gives a Lord's Prayer in the Lipan dialect,
which will serve as a specimen of the language:</p>

<p>'Cutall nezlló ezllá anel ti qui Llatá; setezdanela net
agá nautela; nosesene nda tendajé lle agá tandé:
tanzanenda agá atanclaju, senegui ti ezllza glezi, aj ullú

<p class="sidenote">TINNEH VOCABULARY.</p>
<p>The Navajos, or Apache Navajos, of New Mexico,
like the northern Tinneh, call themselves Tennai, men.
Their dialect approaches the Xicarilla Apache, and Mr
Eaton even asserts that it is about the same.<a id="FNanchor_IIp-71" href="#Footnote_IIp-71" class="fnanchor">[II'-71]</a> Pike
mentions the Nanahaws, which name is probably intended
for Navajos, as no other account can be found of such
a people.</p>

<p>Returned from the south, whither we were led by the
Apache branch of the Tinneh family, let us examine
the languages of our Columbian group. Next along
the seaboard, south of the Thlinkeets, are the Haidahs
and Kaiganies, whose language is spoken on the southern
part of the Prince of Wales Archipelago, and on Queen
Charlotte Island. This language is sometimes called
Haidah, and sometimes Kaiganie,<a id="FNanchor_IIIp-1" href="#Footnote_IIIp-1" class="fnanchor">[III'-1]</a> and although many
tribes belong to these nations, I find among them no
dialectic difference, except that between the Haidahs of
Queen Charlotte Island and the Kaiganies of the
Prince of Wales Archipelago.</p>

<p>Marchand claims that this language is understood by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_605">605</a></span>
the Thlinkeets and other eastern tribes;<a id="FNanchor_IIIp-2" href="#Footnote_IIIp-2" class="fnanchor">[III'-2]</a> Capt. Dixon
thinks it is a distinct and separate tongue;<a id="FNanchor_IIIp-3" href="#Footnote_IIIp-3" class="fnanchor">[III'-3]</a> Scouler
makes one large northern family, which he says spreads
"from the Arctic Circle to the northern extremity of
Quadra and Vancouver's Island;"<a id="FNanchor_IIIp-4" href="#Footnote_IIIp-4" class="fnanchor">[III'-4]</a> Radloff's comparative
researches incline him to the opinion that, although
there may be a few similarities in words between this
and other idioms, as, for example, the Thlinkeet, they
are yet insufficient to prove identity.<a id="FNanchor_IIIp-5" href="#Footnote_IIIp-5" class="fnanchor">[III'-5]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE HAIDAH AND KAIGANIE.</p>

<p>Some of those who have heard the Haidahs speak, say
that their language is uncouth and difficult to articulate,
abounding in consonants, and with a labial and dental
pronunciation;<a id="FNanchor_IIIp-6" href="#Footnote_IIIp-6" class="fnanchor">[III'-6]</a> others affirm that it does not possess the
hard aspirated consonants so frequently found in the
Thlinkeet language, that it is richer in vowels and
softer, though, like the Thlinkeet, it is wanting in labials,
in the dental <i>r</i>, and in the guttural <i>l</i>, while the Haidah
has the clear <i>l</i>.<a id="FNanchor_IIIp-7" href="#Footnote_IIIp-7" class="fnanchor">[III'-7]</a> The Haidah language lacks the letters
<i>b</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>f</i>, and the dental <i>r</i>; neither its substantives nor
adjectives have any gender, and to express the feminine
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_606">606</a></span>
the word <i>dshetta</i>, woman, is added. <i>Itlk dshetta</i>, wife
of the chief; <i>ha</i>, dog; <i>ha dshetta</i>, slut. Neither is
there any particular expression for the plural. <i>Kjéganei</i>,
my house; <i>kjeganei tljönxl lágun</i>, my three houses are
good; <i>tön dsha</i>, thy wife; <i>tön dsha s'töng hána</i>, thy two
wives are both pretty. Two exceptions have been mentioned;&mdash;<i>gjeà</i>,
mast; <i>gjeàng hlöhnhl</i>, three masts; <i>hätä</i>,
man (homo); <i>hátei</i>, men. Substantives are not declined,
but remain unchanged in all cases. <i>Hantl</i>, water; <i>hall
hantl</i>, bring water; <i>tlu</i>, boat; <i>tlu tön gistasa</i>, I give thee
a boat; <i>katt</i>, deer; <i>katt hutsu ziggin</i>, I have a small deer;
<i>slei</i>, hand; <i>hall tön slei</i>, give thy hand. Pronouns are
either distinct words, or are prefixes to substantives
and verbs. Prefixes also denote the possessive case.
To the former class belong <i>htlä</i>, I; and <i>tonga</i>, thou.
To the latter belong <i>te</i>, <i>ti</i>, <i>de</i>, <i>di</i>, <i>zi</i>, <i>kje</i>, <i>teea</i>, <i>tl</i>, <i>t</i>, mine,
all of which are used in the first person singular. Second
person singular, <i>töng</i>, <i>tön</i>, <i>ten</i>, thine; second person
plural, <i>töllöng</i>, yours.</p>

<p>Of the conjugation of the verb, the following may
serve as example: Present indicative&mdash;I am hungry,
<i>tekutke</i>; thou art hungry, <i>töng khúttus</i>; he is hungry,
<i>law khúttung</i>; we are hungry, <i>itl khúttung</i>; you are
hungry, <i>töllöng khúttus</i>; they are hungry, <i>únnas khúttung</i>.
Root words are not of great length. The larger part are
words of one or two syllables; some are of three or four,
but these are rare; nevertheless, words may be agglutinated
to any length.<a id="FNanchor_IIIp-8" href="#Footnote_IIIp-8" class="fnanchor">[III'-8]</a></p>

<p>The Nass language is spoken with very slight differences
by the Nass, Hailtzas, and Sebassas, who dwell
around Observatory Inlet, Millbank Sound, and the
islands of Pitt Archipelago, respectively. Harsh sounds
and gutturals predominate.<a id="FNanchor_IIIp-9" href="#Footnote_IIIp-9" class="fnanchor">[III'-9]</a> The personal pronouns are&mdash;<i>nookwa</i>,
I; <i>cusho</i>, thou; <i>nesho</i>, mine; <i>cusho</i>, thine; <i>nookwintok</i>,
we; <i>kycusko</i>, ye; <i>caigh qua</i>, he; <i>elee caigh qua</i>, they.<a id="FNanchor_IIIp-10" href="#Footnote_IIIp-10" class="fnanchor">[III'-10]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_607">607</a></span></p>

<p>Dunn gives a few sentences, which I insert as specimens:
<i>whealey lowels kussú</i>, where are you going?
<i>howmithlem pooquialla iltsouk</i>, do you understand our
language? <i>lowels, cah cúnter cah míllah</i>, go shoot deer.<a id="FNanchor_IIIp-11" href="#Footnote_IIIp-11" class="fnanchor">[III'-11]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">BELLACOOLA AND CHIMSYAN.</p>

<p>In the immediate vicinity of the Nass are two other
languages, the Bellacoola and Chimsyan, of which hardly
anything is known. Tolmie supposes the Chimsyan to
be related to the Tacully language, but Buschmann, on
comparing the vocabularies, could not find the affinity.
The Rev. Mr Good informs me that the Chimsyan
tongue extends inland as far as Fraser and Stuart
Lake.<a id="FNanchor_IIIp-12" href="#Footnote_IIIp-12" class="fnanchor">[III'-12]</a> Compare the following words:</p>

<p class="sidenote">LANGUAGES OF VANCOUVER ISLAND.</p>

<p>On Vancouver Island a multitude of dialects are spoken,
and various and contradictory classifications have
been made, none of which, in my opinion, are correct.
From the evidence, dialetic diversity prevails to such an
extent that almost every petty tribe has its idiom; so
that, even if affinities do exist, sufficient to justify
a classification into languages and dialects, so meagre
is our knowledge that it is impossible in many instances
to say which are languages and which dialects. Hence
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_608">608</a></span>
in my classification I cannot do better than to make of
the Nootka one language, and give a list of the dialects
on the island, with all the information concerning them
at my command. Four languages of the island&mdash;the
Quackoll in the north, the Cowichin on the east, the
Clallam at the south, and the Makah on the west, are
said to be "totally distinct from each other, both in
sound, formation, and modes of expression." The one
last mentioned is said to bear some affinity to the language
spoken at the mouth of the Columbia River,<a id="FNanchor_IIIp-14" href="#Footnote_IIIp-14" class="fnanchor">[III'-14]</a> and
is called by Sproat the Aht language, for which he
claims in like manner that it "can be traced through
all the tribes on the ocean coast, as far south as the
mouth of the Columbia." The Comux, which people he
locates on the east coast between the Cowichins and
Quackolls, migrated thither, he says, from the main
land, and the tribes "do not readily understand one
another's language;" from all of which we may infer
that in reality there is only one language, of which
these four are the chief dialects.<a id="FNanchor_IIIp-15" href="#Footnote_IIIp-15" class="fnanchor">[III'-15]</a> Yet this is partially
contradicted by Grant, who affirms that the Cowichins
and Clallams can communicate with each other, though
not very easily, but that the Makahs and Quackolls cannot
converse with each other or with any of the other
nations.<a id="FNanchor_IIIp-16" href="#Footnote_IIIp-16" class="fnanchor">[III'-16]</a> Another authority, who certainly ought to be
entitled to an opinion, having been a captive among
these nations for some years, also intimates that in reality
there was only one language dominant on the
island. After enumerating the different tribes he concludes;
"all of whom speak the same language. But
the Newchemass who come from a great way Northward,
and from some distance inland, speak quite a different
language, although it is well understood by those of
Nootka."<a id="FNanchor_IIIp-17" href="#Footnote_IIIp-17" class="fnanchor">[III'-17]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_609">609</a></span></p>

<p>National differences appear to consist more in pronunciation
than in grammatical construction. Thus
the articulation of the Klaizzahts is hoarser and more
guttural than that of the people of Nootka Sound.<a id="FNanchor_IIIp-18" href="#Footnote_IIIp-18" class="fnanchor">[III'-18]</a>
Dialectic differences sometimes go so far that the several
bands of the same tribe find difficulty in making
themselves understood; as for instance the Nitinaht
tribes when conversing with one another, have frequently
to repeat their sentences differently accented to
make them intelligible. The chief peculiarity of the
Nitinaht dialect is the transmutation of the letters <i>m</i>
and <i>n</i>, which are in universal use throughout the island,
for which it substitutes <i>b</i> and <i>d</i>. Thus for <i>mamook</i>, to
work, the Nitinahts say <i>baboik</i>; <i>nismah</i>, country, they
pronounce <i>dissibach</i>, and so on.<a id="FNanchor_IIIp-19" href="#Footnote_IIIp-19" class="fnanchor">[III'-19]</a></p>

<p>As compared with that of the Thlinkeets, the Nootka
language is neither harsh nor disagreeable. Its most
curious feature is the predominance of labials and dentals
over gutturals. The Nootkas possess fine oratorical
powers, lending assistance to their words by shaking
their head, gesticulating forcibly, and even jumping at
each other. A singular sound, and one which it is
hardly possible to express by any combination of letters,
happens in many of their words. Spreading the corners
of the mouth to their widest extent, and raising the
point of the tongue against the palate, they expel the
air from the sides of the mouth, at the same time bringing
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_610">610</a></span>
the tongue down strongly, which obviously produces
a sound altogether foreign to the English vocabulary.
Captain Cook says of this sound, "it is formed, in a
particular manner, by clashing the tongue partly against
the roof of the mouth, with considerable force; and may
be compared to a very coarse or harsh method of lisping,"
and he attempts to give the sound by the letters
<i>lszthl</i>. Many words end with this sound, and also with
a <i>tl</i>, <i>z</i>, or <i>ss</i>;&mdash;as <i>opulszthl</i>, sun; <i>onulszthl</i>, moon; <i>kahsheetl</i>,
dead; <i>teeshcheetl</i>, to throw a stone; <i>kooomitz</i>, a human
skull; <i>quahmiss</i>, fish-roe. Captain Cook further remarks
upon their language that it "can only be inferred, from
their method of speaking, which is very slow and distinct,
that it has few prepositions or conjunctions; and, as
far as we could discover, is destitute of even a single interjection,
to express admiration or surprize."<a id="FNanchor_IIIp-20" href="#Footnote_IIIp-20" class="fnanchor">[III'-20]</a></p>

<p>Furthermore, I may add, there is no case, nor gender,
nor tense, and number is expressed only in the personal
pronoun and in the inflection of verbs. In the first
persons singular and plural, verbs end in <i>a</i> or <i>mah</i>; in
the second persons, <i>huk</i> or <i>ayts</i>; and in the third
persons, in <i>mah</i>, <i>win</i>, or <i>utlma</i>. Sometimes these
endings go over to the adverb which accompanies
the verb, and they are subject to phonetic rules,
according to which syllables are sometimes changed or
left out altogether. We have <i>wik</i>, not; and <i>kumotop</i>, to
understand; <i>wikahkumotop</i> or <i>wimmutomah</i>, I do
not understand; the latter mode being a change for
the sake of euphony. Plurals, and particularly frequentative
plurals, are expressed by duplication: as
<i>mahte</i> or <i>mahs</i>, house; <i>mahtmahs</i>, all the houses. Different
classes of words appear to have different terminals:
for example, instruments end with <i>ik</i>&mdash;<i>hukkaik</i>, a
knife; <i>hissik</i>, a saw. Colors end in <i>uk</i> or <i>ook</i>&mdash;<i>eyyohquk</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_611">611</a></span>
green; <i>kistokkuk</i>, blue; <i>klayhook</i>, purple; <i>kleesook</i>,
white; <i>toopkook</i>, black. <i>Hissit</i>, red, forms an exception.
Trees and plants end in <i>pt</i>&mdash;<i>kowwhipt</i>, <i>seewhipt</i>, <i>ootsmupt</i>,
<i>klakkupt</i>, etc. Verbs end in <i>shitl</i>, <i>shetl</i>, and <i>chitl</i>, although
some exceptions occur. Another distinctive ending is
<i>up</i>&mdash;<i>châtayup</i>, to cut off with a knife; <i>kââsup</i>, to
hurt or wound; <i>hyyusatyup</i>, to diminish; <i>ashsup</i>, to break
a string or cord; <i>quoyup</i>, to break a stick, etc.<a id="FNanchor_IIIp-21" href="#Footnote_IIIp-21" class="fnanchor">[III'-21]</a> As a
specimen of the language, I give the first three of the
Ten Commandments, and the Lord's Prayer, in the
dialect of the Nanaimos.<a id="FNanchor_IIIp-22" href="#Footnote_IIIp-22" class="fnanchor">[III'-22]</a></p>

<p class="p2">From certain interpretations placed upon the ancient
Aztec manuscripts, it was by some inferred that the origin
of that people must be sought in the north; hence
speculative philologists have, from time to time, discovered
many fancied resemblances between the language of
the aboriginal Mexicans and those of various northern
nations. Thus, in the speech of the Nootkas, a distinct
phonetic resemblance, and the frequent occurrence
of the ending <i>tl</i> were sufficient evidence to Vater and
others that a relationship exists between the Aztecs and
the Nootkas. Prescott, following his predecessors, fell
into the same error. Humboldt, although struck with the
similarities mentioned, yet pronounced them different
tongues,<a id="FNanchor_IIIp-23" href="#Footnote_IIIp-23" class="fnanchor">[III'-23]</a> while Buschmann, who has examined the subject
more than all others combined, denies all such
relationship.<a id="FNanchor_IIIp-24" href="#Footnote_IIIp-24" class="fnanchor">[III'-24]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Coming over to the main land we find, for the most
part, in each of the many inlets and canals a separate
language. Between these languages, from perpetual intertribal
intercourse, it is impossible to determine, in some
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_613">613</a></span>
instances, what relationship, if any, exists. Several of
the languages of the island we find also on the main land
adjacent. The Clallams are found on both sides of Juan
de Fuca Straits; and nearly related to the Cowichins,
who are found as well on the main land near the mouth
of Fraser River as on the island, are the Noosdalums of
Hood Canal, one language being but a dialect of the
other.</p>

<p class="sidenote">LANGUAGES OF BRITISH COLUMBIA.</p>

<p>Respecting the languages spoken in the interior of
British Columbia, the Rev. Mr Good, who has spent
fifteen years among the inland nations, and who is fully
conversant with their languages, gives me the following
information: From Yale to Lillooet, on the
Fraser River, thence from Bonaparte to Nicola River,
the Neetlakapamuch, or Thompson River, language
is spoken. From Douglas, along the Harrison River
and lake, to its confluence with the Fraser, as far
as Chilicothe, and again from Lillooet northward to
Clinton, the Stlatelemuck, or Lillooet, language prevails.
Next, from Bonaparte River northward to William Lake,
to Shushwap Lake, around Lake Kamloops, and for some
distance on the Thompson River, the Suwapamuck, or
Shushwap, tongue prevails; and finally, from Nicola Lake
to Kamloops, and southward as far as Columbia River, the
Chitwout, or Similkameen, language is used. Mr Good
further asserts that, although there are four distinct
languages, they are nevertheless in some degree affiliated.
From the same gentleman, I also obtained the following
grammatical notes and specimens of the Neetlakapamuch
tongue. Personal pronouns are&mdash;I, <i>ens</i>; thou, <i>awee</i>;
he, <i>cheneelt</i>; we, <i>nemeemult</i>; you, <i>aweepeeaps</i>; they,
<i>chinkoast</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mamans</i> inserted in a word, signifies a desire to do a
thing; thus, <i>winaskin</i> means to go; and <i>winasmamankin</i>,
I am wishing to go. The syllable <i>weltin</i>, affixed to a
word, expresses that a thing has been done effectively;&mdash;<i>tlokhtinnaweltin</i>,
I have fastened it well, or thoroughly.
<i>Tata</i> is a negative preposition.</p>

<p class="sidenote">PUGET SOUND DIALECTS.</p>

<p>Proceeding southward to Puget Sound, we have
the Shimiahmoo, Nooksak, Lummi, Samish, Snohomish,
and others; and around Cape Flattery, the Classet.
The Makah, Classet, or Klaizzaht, I have spoken of
already, in connection with the language of Vancouver
Island, and it also appears that the Clallam, S'klalum,
or as they call themselves, Nusklaiyum, is also connected
with the Vancouver Island language.<a id="FNanchor_IIIp-25" href="#Footnote_IIIp-25" class="fnanchor">[III'-25]</a> It is probably
the same which Dr Scouler has called the Noosdalum.
The Lummi, or Nukhlumi, and the Shimiahmoo have
also some affinity with the Sanetch dialect of Vancouver
Island, and the languages of the Skagits and Samish
approach that of the Nisquallies. Yet while the Clallam
and Lummi show certain affinities to the Nootka dialect,
they nevertheless clearly belong to the Salish, or Flathead
family.<a id="FNanchor_IIIp-26" href="#Footnote_IIIp-26" class="fnanchor">[III'-26]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">SALISH DIALECTS.</p>

<p class="p2">We now come to the great interior Salish family,
although I shall have occasion again to refer to the coast
language in this vicinity. The northernmost Salish
language is the Shushwap, or Atnah, which approaches
near to its neighbor the Salish proper;<a id="FNanchor_IIIp-27" href="#Footnote_IIIp-27" class="fnanchor">[III'-27]</a> then there are
the Kullespelm, or Pend d'Oreille, the Spokane, the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_616">616</a></span>
Soaiatlpi, and the Okanagan, which with others spoken on
the Columbia show close affinities.</p>

<p>The Salish proper, or Flathead, is harsh and guttural.
The letters <i>b</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>v</i>, do not exist in this language. The
plural of substantives is formed in different ways: first,
by duplicating the root&mdash;<i>skoi</i>, mother; <i>skoikoi</i>, mothers:
second by duplicating and dropping a vowel from the
root&mdash;<i>skaltmigu</i>, man; <i>sklkaltmigu</i>, men; <i>esmòck</i>, mountain;
<i>esmòkmck</i>, mountains: third, by duplicating a consonant
in the middle of the word&mdash;<i>skòlchemùs</i>, eyelid; <i>skòlchammùs</i>,
eyelids: fourth, by prefixing the syllable <i>ul</i>&mdash;<i>nackoèmen</i>,
thief; <i>ulnakoèmen</i>, thieves: and lastly there are
divers formations, as <i>es´schíte</i>, tree; <i>szlzlíl</i>, trees, forest;
<i>s´m´èm</i>, woman (mulier); <i>pèlplgui</i>, women. Diminutives
are expressed by placing <i>l</i> before the root, as, <i>s´m´èm</i>,
woman; <i>slm´èm</i>, small woman; <i>lùk</i>, wood; <i>llùl´lk</i>, a small
piece of wood. Augmentatives are formed by prefixing
the syllable <i>kutn</i>, or <i>kuti</i>, when the word commences
with an <i>s</i> or <i>l</i>, thus, <i>skagae</i>, horse; <i>kuti-skagae</i>, a great horse;
<i>sm´ot</i>, smoke; <i>kuti-sm´ot</i>, a great smoke. There are pronouns,
personal, possessive, demonstrative, relative, interrogative,
and indefinite. According to Mengarini the
personal pronoun has two forms, absolute and copulative,
the exact meaning attached to these terms not being explained.</p>

<p>Also belonging to this family are the languages spoken
by the Skitsuish, Pisquouse, Nsietshaws, Nisquallies, and
Chehalis. The Nsietshaw differs more than the others
from the Salish proper, which is the stock language of
this family, and particularly in not possessing any
labials; the letters <i>m</i> and <i>b</i> being changed to <i>w</i>, and <i>p</i>
to <i>h</i>. Thus, in the Chehalis and Nisqually languages,
we have, <i>numan</i>, son; <i>tomokh</i>, earth; <i>pansototsi</i>, winter;
which, in the Nsietshaw, are pronounced respectively,
<i>nuwon</i>, <i>tawekh</i> and <i>hansototsi</i>. The Chehalis is spoken in
three dialects, the Chehalis proper, the Quaiantl, and the
Queniauitl.<a id="FNanchor_IIIp-30" href="#Footnote_IIIp-30" class="fnanchor">[III'-30]</a></p>

<p>The languages of the Salish Family, particularly that
of the Chehalis, are rich in words, by means of which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_619">619</a></span>
everything coming within their knowledge may find
expression; they are not easily acquired by strangers;
it is difficult for the different nations and tribes to make
themselves understood to one another. This is owing
principally to the many localisms in vogue among them,
of which there is a good specimen in the Chehalis language.
Thus, <i>tolneuch</i> means west-wind, off shore, toward
the sea, or to the west. Now, if the Chehalis are
leaving the shore in a canoe, and one of them wants to
tell his mate to put her head off shore, he will say
<i>tolneuch</i>, but if in a hurry, <i>neuch neuch</i>. <i>Claathlum</i> signifies
east-wind, also ashore; this they transpose into
<i>clath clath</i>.<a id="FNanchor_IIIp-31" href="#Footnote_IIIp-31" class="fnanchor">[III'-31]</a> The Clallum and Lummi languages have
another peculiarity, which is a certain nasal sound at
the commencement and ending of words like a strong
nasal <i>ns</i>; also a broad <i>a</i> sound as in far, path. The
sounds of the letters <i>v</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>z</i>, are wanting.<a id="FNanchor_IIIp-32" href="#Footnote_IIIp-32" class="fnanchor">[III'-32]</a> The frequently
occurring ending <i>tl</i> has also led to speculation,
and to a search for Aztec affinities among these languages,
but nothing except this phonetic similarity has
been discovered. This <i>tl</i> ending is very common. Swan
says that, "sometimes they will, as if for amusement,
end all their words with <i>tl</i>; and the effect is ludicrous
to hear three or four talking at the same time, with this
singular sound, like so many sitting hens.'<a id="FNanchor_IIIp-33" href="#Footnote_IIIp-33" class="fnanchor">[III'-33]</a> East of
the Salish, the Kitunaha, Kootenai, or Coutanie language
is spoken. Authorities differ widely in describing this
language. Parker calls it "open and sonorous, and free
from gutturals, which are common in the language of the
surrounding tribes;" while Capt. Palliser affirms that it
is "most guttural and unpronounceable by a European,
every word appearing to be brought from their lowest
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_620">620</a></span>
extremities with difficulty."<a id="FNanchor_IIIp-34" href="#Footnote_IIIp-34" class="fnanchor">[III'-34]</a> The following Lord's
Prayer, taken by a Frenchman will give a better idea of
the language than any description:</p>

<p class="sidenote">SAHAPTIN LANGUAGES.</p>

<p>The languages of the Sahaptin family are spoken
along the Lewis and Snake Rivers and their tributaries,
as far as the foot of the Rocky Mountains. The Walla
Walla, Palouse, Yakima, Kliketat, and Sahaptin
proper, some of them widely divergent from the mother
tongue, are of this family.<a id="FNanchor_IIIp-36" href="#Footnote_IIIp-36" class="fnanchor">[III'-36]</a> The Walla Walla differs
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_621">621</a></span>
from the Sahaptin proper not more than the Portuguese
from the Spanish. Father Pandosy made a grammar
of the Yakima language, under which he ranges the
whole Sahaptin family, dividing it into dialects, as the
Walla Walla, the Tairtla, the Roilroilpam, or Kliketat,
and the Palouse.<a id="FNanchor_IIIp-37" href="#Footnote_IIIp-37" class="fnanchor">[III'-37]</a></p>

<p>In the Nez Percé language, the following letters only
are found: <i>h</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>l</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>s</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>w</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>u</i>, but the
missionaries having introduced some new words, it was
found necessary to add <i>b</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>v</i>, <i>z</i>. Agglutination is
carried to a great length, and long words are very frequent.
In fact, wherever a sentence can be expressed
by joining one word to another, it is done, leaving out
letters in places, for the sake of euphony. The following
is a fair illustration: <i>hitautualawihnankauna</i>, he traveled
past in a rainy night. Analysed, <i>hi</i> expresses the third
person singular; <i>tau</i> a thing done at night; <i>tuala</i>, something
done in the rain; <i>wihnan</i>, to travel on foot;
<i>kau</i> is derived from the verb <i>kokauna</i>, to pass by;
<i>na</i> expresses the indicative mood, aorist tense, direction
from the speaker. The plural of substantives is
formed by duplicating the first syllable: <i>pitin</i>, girl;
<i>pipitin</i>, girls. Or when the word commences with a
vowel, the vowel is sometimes repeated: <i>atwai</i>, old
woman; <i>aatwai</i>, old women. Exceptions to this rule
are made in words expressing family relations, the prefix
<i>ma</i> being employed in such cases, as <i>pika</i>, mother;
<i>pikama</i>, mothers. If <i>p</i> terminates the word, it is
omitted, as <i>askap</i>, plural <i>askama</i>. To express gender,
the words <i>hama</i>, male, and <i>aiat</i>, female, are employed,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_622">622</a></span>
but the substantive remains unchanged. Nouns are
declined either by changing their terminals, or by
affixes:</p>

<p>The Nez Percés make use of two languages, one the
native language proper, or, as a European might say,
the court language, and the other a slave language, or
jargon. They differ so much, that a stranger fully conversant
with one cannot understand the other. This
jargon originated, probably, from intermixing prisoners
of war of different nationalities who were enslaved, and
their languages mingled with each other, and with
that of their conquerors. The pure-blooded Nez Percés
all understand the jargon, learning it when children,
together with their own proper language. Nor is this
all. The jargon is more or less modified by each of the
several languages, or dialects, in which it is spoken. The
employés of the fur companies, who first came in contact
with the Sahaptins, were greatly annoyed by this
multiformity; as, for example, one Nez Percé coming
to sell a beaver skin would say, <i>tammecess taxpool</i>, I wish
to sell a beaver; another would say, <i>towèyou weespoose</i>, I
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_625">625</a></span>
wish to trade a beaver; and a third would say, <i>e'towpa
e'yechc&oelig;</i>, I wish to trade a beaver.</p>

<p>The following short vocabulary will show some of the
differences between the Nez Percé language and the
jargon:</p>

<p>Professor Rafinesque, out of twenty-four Sahaptin
words, claims to have found six bearing close affinities
to the English, but Buschmann says that of these
twenty-four, many are not Sahaptin at all.<a id="FNanchor_IIIp-41" href="#Footnote_IIIp-41" class="fnanchor">[III'-41]</a> The
Waiilatpu language, conterminous with the Sahaptin, is
spoken in two dialects, the Cayuse and Mollale. The
Cayuses mingle frequently with the Sahaptins, and therefore
many words of the latter have been adopted into
their tongue. They mostly understand and speak the
Sahaptin, and frequently the Walla Walla, and this not
from any relationship in the several languages, but
from intercourse.<a id="FNanchor_IIIp-42" href="#Footnote_IIIp-42" class="fnanchor">[III'-42]</a></p>

<p>Like their neighbors, the Cayuses employ two languages;
one in the transaction of the common affairs of
life, and the other on high state occasions, such as when
making speeches round the council fire, to determine
questions of war and peace, as well as all other intertribal
affairs. That is to say, the Sahaptins use their
court language on all ordinary, as well as extraordinary
occasions, keeping the jargon for their servants, while
the Cayuses employ the baser tongue for common, and
the higher for state occasions.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_626">626</a></span></p>

<p>The Cayuses were eloquent speakers; their language
abounded in elegant expressions, and they well knew
how to make the most of it. When first known to
Europeans, it was fast fading away, and subsequently
merged into the Sahaptin; so fleeting are these native
idioms.<a id="FNanchor_IIIp-43" href="#Footnote_IIIp-43" class="fnanchor">[III'-43]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">DIFFICULTIES OF THE CHINOOK.</p>

<p>The Chinook language is spoken by the different
tribes inhabiting the banks of the Lower Columbia and
adjacent country. This family is divided into many
dialects, which diverge from the mother tongue as we
ascend the river; in fact, the upper tribes have mostly
to employ an interpreter, when they communicate with
those on the lower part of the river. The chief diversities
of this language are the Chinook proper, the Wakiakum,
Cathlamet, and Clatsop, and the various dialects
mentioned by Lewis and Clarke as belonging to those inhabiting
this region at the time of their expedition, but
which cannot now be positively identified with any of
the languages known to us. Two of the last-mentioned
dialects, the Multnomah and the Skilloot, the explorers
describe as belonging to the Chinook.<a id="FNanchor_IIIp-44" href="#Footnote_IIIp-44" class="fnanchor">[III'-44]</a> Among all the
languages of north-western America, except perhaps that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_627">627</a></span>
of the Thlinkeets, the Chinook is considered in its construction
the most intricate; and in its pronunciation the
most difficult. No words are to be found in the English
vocabulary which can accurately describe it. To say
that it is guttural, clucking, spluttering, and the like
conveys but a faint conception of the sound produced
by a Chinook in his frantic effort to unburden his mind
of an idea. He does not appear to have yet discovered
the use of the lips and tongue in speaking, but struggles
with the lower part of the throat to produce sounds
for the expression of his thoughts. Some declare that
the speech of the Thlinkeets, whose language like
that of the Chinook contains no labials, is melody in
comparison to the croakings of the Chinooks. Ross says,
that "to speak the Chinook dialect, you must be a Chinook."<a id="FNanchor_IIIp-45" href="#Footnote_IIIp-45" class="fnanchor">[III'-45]</a>
Indeed, they appear to have become tired of
their own language and to have voluntarily abandoned
it, for, to-day, the youthful Chinook speaks almost
wholly Chehalis and the jargon. The employés of the
fur companies, voyageurs, trappers and traders, who
were accustomed to master with little difficulty the aboriginal
tongues which they encountered, were completely
nonplussed by the Chinook. A Canadian of Astor's
company is the only person known to have acquired
it so as to speak it fluently. During a long illness he
was nursed by the Chinooks, and during his convalescence
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_628">628</a></span>
devoted his entire time to perfecting himself in
their tongue.<a id="FNanchor_IIIp-46" href="#Footnote_IIIp-46" class="fnanchor">[III'-46]</a></p>

<p>Here the sounds of the letters <i>f</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>v</i>, and <i>z</i> do not
exist, the pronunciation is generally very indistinct, and
<i>ç</i> and <i>s</i>, <i>k</i> and <i>g</i>, <i>d</i> and <i>t</i>, are almost always confounded.</p>

the peoples mentioned, whose lands are drained by

he discovered not alone by direct comparisons with the
Aztec, but also by detecting resemblances between these
Columbian dialects and those of certain nations which

he calls his Sonora group and its affiliations, all of which

<p class="sidenote">ANALYSIS OF THE CHINOOK JARGON.</p>

<p>The Chinook jargon is employed by the white
people in their intercourse with the natives, as well as
by the natives among themselves. It is spoken throughout
Oregon, Washington Territory, on Vancouver Island,
and extends inland into Idaho and some parts of Montana.
It is more than probable that, like other languages
<i>de convenance</i>, it formed itself gradually, first among the
natives themselves, and that in the course of time, in
order to facilitate their intercourse with the aborigines,
trappers and traders adopted and improved it, until it
was finally brought into its present state. Indeed, so
great was the diversity of languages in this vicinity, and
so intricate were they, that without something of this
kind there could have been but little intercourse between
the people.</p>

<p>A somewhat similar mixture I have already mentioned
as existing in Alaska. Father Paul Le Jeune
gives a short account of a jargon in use between the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_632">632</a></span>
French and the Indians, in the north-eastern part of
America, as early as the year 1633.<a id="FNanchor_IIIp-52" href="#Footnote_IIIp-52" class="fnanchor">[III'-52]</a> In Europe a similar
mixture, or patois, prevails to this day, the lingua
franca, used by the many nationalities that congregate
upon the shores of the Mediterranean. In
China, and in the East Indies, the so-called pigeon
English occupies the same place; and in various parts
of Central and Southern America, neutral languages
may be found. To show how languages spring up and
grow, Vancouver, when visiting the coast in 1792,
found in various places along the shores of Oregon,
Washington, and Vancouver Island, nations that now
and then understood words and sentences of the Nootka
and other tongues, some of which had been adopted
into their own language.</p>

<p>When Lewis and Clarke, in 1806, reached the coast,
the jargon seems to have already assumed a fixed shape,
as may be seen from the sentences quoted by the explorers.
But not until the arrival of the expedition sent out by
John Jacob Astor does it appear that either English or
French words, of which it contains a large percentage,
were incorporated. Very few, if any, of the words of
which the jargon is composed, retain their original shape.
The harsh, guttural, and unpronounceable native cackling
was softened or omitted, thus forming a speech suited
to all. In the same manner, some of the English sounds,
like <i>f</i> and <i>r</i>, unpronounceable by the native, were
dropped, or transferred into <i>p</i> and <i>l</i>, while all grammatical
forms were reduced to the fewest and plainest rules
possible.<a id="FNanchor_IIIp-53" href="#Footnote_IIIp-53" class="fnanchor">[III'-53]</a>  But even in this jargon, there are what
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_633">633</a></span>
may be called dialectic differences; for instance, many
words used at the Dalles, are quite unintelligible at the
mouth of the Columbia and at Puget Sound. It has
often been asserted that the jargon was invented or
originated by the Hudson's Bay Company, but although
the fur company undoubtedly greatly aided its development,
and assisted in perfecting it, it is well known,
first, that this jargon existed before the advent of
Europeans, and secondly, that languages are not made
in this way.</p>

<p>Mr Gibbs states the number of words to be nearly
five hundred, and after a careful analysis of the language,
has arrived at the following conclusion as to the number
contributed by the several nationalities:</p>

<p>As before mentioned, foreign words adopted into the
jargon vocabulary are changed to suit the taste of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_634">634</a></span>
speaker, as in the word Français, being unable to pronounce
the <i>f</i>, <i>r</i>, and <i>n</i>, for Frenchman they say <i>pasaiuks</i>,
and for French, <i>pasai</i>. The few words formed by
onomatop&oelig;ia, are after this fashion;&mdash;<i>tumtum</i>, heart, an
imitation of its beating; <i>tintin</i>, bell; <i>tiktik</i>, watch; <i>liplip</i>,
to boil, from the sound of boiling water, and so on.</p>

<p>Neither article nor inflections are employed. <i>Okok</i>,
this, at times takes the place of the English the. As a
rule, plurals are not distinguished, but sometimes the
word <i>haiu</i>, many, is used. Adjectives precede nouns, as
in English&mdash;<i>lasuai hakatshum</i>, silk handkerchief; <i>masatsi
tilikum</i>, bad people. The comparative is expressed, for
example, in the sentence, I am stronger than thou, by <i>wek
maika skukum kakwa naika</i>, thou not strong as I.
Superlative&mdash;<i>haias oluman okok kanem</i>, very old that
canoe. There are only two conjunctions, <i>pi</i>, derived
from the French <i>puis</i>, which denotes and or then; and
<i>pos</i>, from <i>suppose</i>, meaning if, in case that, provided
that. The particle <i>na</i> is at times used as an interrogative.<a id="FNanchor_IIIp-55" href="#Footnote_IIIp-55" class="fnanchor">[III'-55]</a></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the great diversity of tongues encountered
in the regions of the north, the confusion
increases ten-fold on entering California. Probably
nowhere in America is there a greater multiformity of
languages and dialects than here. Until quite recently,
no attempt has been made to bring order out of this
linguistic chaos, owing mainly to a lack of grammars
and vocabularies. Within the last few years this want
has, in a measure, been supplied, and I hope to be able
to present some broader classifications than have hitherto
been attempted. Through the researches of Mr Powers,
who has kindly placed his materials at my disposal, and
the valuable information communicated by Judge Roseborough,
the dialects of northern California have been
reduced to some sort of system, yet there remains the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_636">636</a></span>
fact that, in central and southern California, hundreds
of dialects have been permitted to die out, without
leaving us so much as their name.<a id="FNanchor_IVp-1" href="#Footnote_IVp-1" class="fnanchor">[IV'-1]</a></p>

<p>In attempting the classification of Californian tongues,
no little difficulty arises from the ambiguity of tribal
names. So far as appearances go, some peoples have no
distinctive name; others are known by the name of their
chief alone, or their ranchería; the affiliation of chief,
ranchería, and tribe being identical or distinct, as the
case may be. Some writers have a common name for
all tribes speaking the same, or dialects of the same, language;
others name a people from each dialect. Last
of all, there are nations and tribes that call themselves
by one name, while their neighbors call them by another,
so that the classifier, ethnologic or philologic, is apt to
enumerate one people under two names, while omitting
many.<a id="FNanchor_IVp-2" href="#Footnote_IVp-2" class="fnanchor">[IV'-2]</a></p>

<p>We have seen in the Columbian languages, as we
approach the south, that they become softer and less
guttural; this is yet more observable among Californians,
whose speech, for the most part, is harmonious, pronounceable,
and rich in vowels; and this feature becomes
more and more marked as we proceed from northern to
southern California. On this point, Mr Powers writes:
"Not only are the California languages distinguished for
that affluence of vowel sounds, which is more or less
characteristic of all tongues spoken in warm climates;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_637">637</a></span>
but most of them are also remarkable for their special
striving after harmony. There are a few languages found
in the northern mountains which are harsh and sesquipedalian,
and some on the coast that are guttural beyond
the compass of our American organs of speech; but with
these few exceptions, the numerous languages of the
state are beautiful above all their neighbors for their
simplicity, the brevity of their words, their melody, and
their harmonious sequences."<a id="FNanchor_IVp-3" href="#Footnote_IVp-3" class="fnanchor">[IV'-3]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">RULES OF EUPHONY IN CALIFORNIA.</p>

<p>Throughout California, much attention is paid to the
euphony of words; and if, in the inevitable manufacturing
process, a syllable does not sound well, or does not exactly
harmonize according to the native ear, it is ruthlessly
sacrificed. In many languages these elisions are
made in accordance with fixed rules, while others, again,
obey no other mandate but harmony.</p>

<p>Concerning the languages of northern California,
Judge Roseborough writes: "In an ethnological view,
the language of these various tribes is a subject of great
interest. They seem to be governed by the geographical
nature of the country, which has had much influence
in directing the migrations and settlement of the various
tribes in this state, where they have been found by the
whites; and there have been in remote times at least three
currents, or lines of migration, namely&mdash;first, one along
the coast southward, dispersing more or less towards the
interior as the nature of the country and hostile tribes permitted.
In so broken and rough a country the migrations
must have been slow, and the eddies numerous, leaving
many fragments of aboriginal tribes here and there
with language and customs wholly dissimilar. Second,
that along the Willamette Valley, over the passes of
the Calapooya, across the open lands of the Umpqua,
southward through Rogue River Valley into Shasta and
Scott valleys. As an evidence of this trace I may
mention that all the tribes on this line, from the Calapooya
mountains southward to the head of Shasta and Scott
valleys, speak the same language, and were confederate
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_638">638</a></span>
in their wars with the tribes on Pitt River, who seem
to have arrested their progress southward. In this connection
I may mention two facts worthy of remark,
namely, first, in this cataclysm of tribes, there have been
some singular displacements; for instance, the similarity
of language and customs of the Cumbatwas and other
cognate tribes on Pitt River denotes a common origin
with a small tribe found on Smith River, on the north-west
coast: and secondly, the traditions of the Shastas
settled in Shasta and Scott valleys, the advance of this
line of migrations, show that a former tribe had been
found in possession of those valleys and mountains, and
had been driven out. The remains of their ancient
villages, and the arrangements still visible in their
excavations confirm the fact, and also the further fact
that the expelled tribes were the same, or cognate to
those which the whites found in occupation of the Sacramento
Valley. For instance, in all of these ancient
villages, there was one house of very large dimensions,
used for feasts, ceremonious dances, etc., just as we
found on the settlement of California, in the valley of
Sacramento. The existing tribes in those mountains
have no such domicil and no public houses. They say,
when asked, that the villages were built and inhabited
by a tribe that lived there before they came, and that
those ancient dwellers worshiped the great snowy Mount
Shasta, and always built their villages in places from
which they could behold that mountain. Thirdly,
another wave of migration evidently came southward
along the Des Chutes River, upon the great plateau of
the lakes, which conclusion is borne out by a similarity
of languages and customs, as well as by traditions."<a id="FNanchor_IVp-4" href="#Footnote_IVp-4" class="fnanchor">[IV'-4]</a></p>

<p>In support of this theory, Judge Roseborough states
that the languages spoken on Smith River, and extending
thence forty miles along the coast, are radically and
wholly different from those of the neighboring tribes.
The former are harsh, guttural, irregular, and apparently
monosyllabic, while on the other hand, the neighboring
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_639">639</a></span>
tribes inhabiting the coast southward to Humboldt Bay,
and along the Klamath as far up as the mouth of the
Trinity, speak a language very regular in its structure;
copious in its capacity for expressing ideas and shades of
thought, and not unpleasing to the ear, being free from
harsh and guttural sounds. Of all the languages spoken
in this part, that which prevails along the Klamath
River, as far up as Happy Camp, and along the Salmon
to its sources, is by far the most regular and musical.
In fact, for its regular and musical accents it occupies
among the Indian tongues of the continent the same
preëminence that the Spanish does among the Caucasian
languages. For instance, their proper nouns for
persons and places are very euphoneous, as, <i>euphippa</i>,
<i>escassasoo</i>, names of persons, and <i>tahasoofca</i>, <i>cheenich</i>, <i>panumna</i>,
<i>chimicanee</i>, <i>tooyook</i>, <i>savorum</i>, names of noted localities
along the river.</p>

<p>As an example of the copiousness and richness of
the coast languages above Humboldt Bay, Judge Roseborough
cites the following, for one, two, three, four,
they say, <i>kor</i>, <i>nihhi</i>, <i>naxil</i>, <i>chohnah</i>; so for to-morrow they
say, <i>kohchamol</i>; for the day after to-morrow, <i>nahamohl</i>;
three days hence, <i>naxamohl</i>; four days hence, <i>chohnahamol</i>.
Nor do they stop here; <i>mare</i>, being five, and
<i>marunimícha</i>, fifteen; the fifteenth day from the present
is, <i>marunimîcháhamohl</i>.</p>

<p>Mr George Bancroft in his Indianology erroneously
asserts that the sound of our letter <i>r</i> does not occur in
any of the aboriginal languages of America. A similar
assertion has been made with regard to Asiatic tongues,
that there is not a people from the peninsula of Hindostan
to Kamchatka who make use of this sound. Although
this idea is now exploded, evidence goes to show the
rarity of the use of the letter <i>r</i> in these regions; yet,
Judge Roseborough assures me that in these northern
Californian dialects the sound of this letter is not only
frequent, but is uttered with its most rolling, whirring
emphasis; that such words as <i>arrarra</i>, Indian; <i>carrook</i>,
or <i>cahroc</i>, up; <i>eurook</i>, or <i>euroc</i>, down; <i>seearrook</i>, across
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_640">640</a></span>
and up; <i>micarra</i>, the name of a village; <i>tahasoofcarrah</i>,
that is to say the village of upper Tahasoofca, are
brought forth with an intensity that a Frenchman could
not exceed.</p>

<p class="p2">On both sides of the Oregon and Californian boundary
line is spoken the Klamath language; adjoining it on
the north is the Yakon, and on the south the Shasta and
the Palaik. A dialect of the Klamath is also spoken by
the Modocs. Herewith I give a short comparative table,
and although no relationship between them is claimed,
yet many of the words which I have selected are not
without a similarity.<a id="FNanchor_IVp-5" href="#Footnote_IVp-5" class="fnanchor">[IV'-5]</a></p>

<p>On the lower Klamath, the Euroc language prevails.
As compared with the dialects of southern California,
it is guttural; there being apparently in some of its
words, or rather grunts, a total absence of vowels&mdash;<i>mrprh</i>,
nose; <i>chlh</i>, earth; <i>ynx</i>, child. Among other
sounds peculiar to it, there is that of the <i>ll</i>, so frequent
in the Welsh language. Mr Powers says that, "in
conversation they terminate many words with an aspiration
which is imperfectly indicated by the letter <i>h</i>, a
sort of catching of the sound, immediately followed by
the letting out of the residue of breath, with a quick
little grunt. This makes their speech harsh and halting;
the voice often comes to a dead stop in the middle of a
sentence." He further adds that "the language seems
to have had a monosyllabic origin, and, in fact, they
pronounce many dissyllables as if they were two monosyllables."</p>

<p>Along the upper Klamath, the Cahroc language is
spoken, which is entirely distinct from that of the
Eurocs. It is sonorous, and its intonation has even
been compared with that of the Spanish, being not
at all guttural like the Euroc. The <i>r</i>, when it occurs
in such words as <i>chareya</i>, and <i>cahroc</i>, is strangely
rolled. The language is copious; the people speaking it
having a name for everything, and on seeing any article
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_642">642</a></span>
new to them, if a proper designation is not immediately
at hand, they forthwith proceed to manufacture one.</p>

<p>Another guttural language is the Pataway, spoken on
Trinity River. Its pronunciation is like the Euroc, and
it has the same curious, abrupt stopping of the voice at
the end of syllables terminating with a vowel, as Mr
Powers describes it. Related to it is the Veeard of
lower Humboldt Bay. The numerals in the latter language
are: <i>koh-tseh</i>, one; <i>dee-teh</i>, two; <i>dee-keh</i>, three;
<i>deeh-oh</i>, four; <i>weh-sah</i>, five; <i>chilókeh</i>, six; <i>awtloh</i>, seven;
<i>owit</i>, eight; <i>serókeh</i>, nine; <i>lokél</i> ten.<a id="FNanchor_IVp-8" href="#Footnote_IVp-8" class="fnanchor">[IV'-8]</a></p>

<p>The language known as the Weitspek, spoken at the
junction of the Trinity and Klamath rivers, is probably
the same which Mr Powers has named the Pataway.
It is also said to have the frequently occurring rolling <i>r</i>.
The <i>f</i>, as in the Oregon languages, is wanting. Dialects
of the Weitspek are the Weeyot and Wishosk, on
Eel and Mad rivers. This language is understood from
the coast range down to the coast between Cape Mendocino
and Mad River.<a id="FNanchor_IVp-9" href="#Footnote_IVp-9" class="fnanchor">[IV'-9]</a> The Ehnek, or Pehtsik, language
is spoken on Salmon River; thence in the region of the
Klamath, are the Watsahewah, Howteteoh, and Nabiltse
languages.<a id="FNanchor_IVp-10" href="#Footnote_IVp-10" class="fnanchor">[IV'-10]</a></p>

<p>The Chillulah, Wheelcutta, and Kailta were spoken
on Redwood Creek, but before the extinction of these
people, their languages were merged into that of the
Hoopahs by whom they were subjugated. The language
of the Chimalquays of New River has also been absorbed
by the Hoopah. Of the Chimalquays Powers
hyperbolically remarks "their language was like the
mountain city of California, beautiful in its simplicity,
but frail."<a id="FNanchor_IVp-11" href="#Footnote_IVp-11" class="fnanchor">[IV'-11]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE POMO FAMILY AND ITS DIALECTS.</p>

<p>At Humboldt Bay a language called Patawat is mentioned,
and in Round Valley the Yuka. The numerals
in the latter tongue are&mdash;<i>pongwe</i>, one; <i>opeh</i>, two; <i>malmeh</i>,
three; and <i>omehet</i>, four. In Potter Valley is the Tahtoo
language which Mr Powers thinks may belong to the
Pomo or the Yuka.<a id="FNanchor_IVp-12" href="#Footnote_IVp-12" class="fnanchor">[IV'-12]</a> In the Eel River and Russian
River valleys as far as the mouth of Russian River and
in Potter Valley, the different tribes known by the
names of Ukiahs or Yokias, Sanèls, Gallinomeros, Masallamagoons,
Gualalas, and Matoles, speak various dialects
of the Pomo language, which obtains in Potter
Valley and the dialects of which become more and more
estranged according to the distance from the aboriginal
centre. The Pomo men are good linguists; they readily
acquire all the different dialects of their language, which
in places differ to such an extent, that unless they are
previously learned they cannot be understood. Pomo
women are not allowed to learn any dialect but their
own.</p>

<p>The following comparative table of numerals will
illustrate the relationship of these tribes, among which
I include the Kulanapo spoken near Clear Lake, and of
which Mr Gibbs has also noticed an affinity to the Russian
River and Eel River languages; also, the language
spoken by the natives of the Yonios Ranchería in Marin
County.<a id="FNanchor_IVp-13" href="#Footnote_IVp-13" class="fnanchor">[IV'-13]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">GALLINOMERO GRAMMAR.</p>

<p>On the Gallinomero dialect I make a few grammatical
remarks. In conversation the Gallinomeros are rather
slovenly and make use of frequent contractions and abbreviations
like the English can't and shan't, which makes
it difficult for a stranger to understand them. Another
difficulty for the student is the convertibility of a number
of letters, such as <i>t</i> into <i>ch</i>, <i>sh</i> into <i>ch</i>, <i>i</i> into <i>ah</i>, etc.
Nouns have neither number, case, nor gender; the first
being only occasionally indicated by a separate word&mdash;<i>cha
ataboónya</i>, one man; <i>aco ataboónja</i>, two men. The
genitive is formed by placing the words in juxtaposition&mdash;<i>atópte
meätega</i>, the chief's brother; the governed word
being always prepositive. None of the remaining cases
are distinguished; for example&mdash;<i>chadúna bidácha</i>, I see
the river; <i>bidácha hoalye</i>, I go to the river, or, into the
river; <i>bidácha huodúna</i>, I come out of the river; <i>didácha
toholeéna</i>, I go away from the river; the accusative
may be recognized as being placed immediately after the
verb, but there are many exceptions to this rule. Sometimes
the accusative is also marked by the ending <i>ga</i>
or <i>gen</i>&mdash;<i>chechoanoótugen</i>, I strike the boy; but this is
seldom used. Verbs are always regular. There are
present, imperfect, and future tenses, and three forms of
the imperative, all distinctly marked by tense endings.</p>

<p>In some instances these endings are changed for the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_645">645</a></span>
sake of euphony, certain letters being elided. The endings
may really be called auxiliary verbs, attached to
the principal verb. Thus the imperfect reads, literally,
'would be I go do,' the ending <i>teena</i>, being nothing but
the word <i>tseena</i>, with the <i>s</i> omitted. In like manner the
future is formed, as in <i>tudáwa</i>, to want, which is changed
into <i>cúwa</i>.</p>

<p>There is nothing to denote number in the verb, as can
be seen in the</p>

<p class="p2 center">CONJUGATION OF THE VERB TO BE.</p>

<p>Of the imperative, the following may serve as an
example: <i>hoáleluh</i>, let me go; <i>hoalin</i>, go thou; <i>hoálegun</i>,
let him go. The verb <i>chadúna</i>, to see, may signify
either I see, or seeing, or to see, or it may be construed
as a substantive&mdash;sight; or as an adjective in agglutination,
as <i>chadunatoboónya</i>, a watchful man. <i>Chanhódin</i>
is an auxiliary verb and is always prepositive. The
pronouns are, <i>ah</i>, <i>ahto</i>, or <i>ahmet</i>, I; <i>ama</i>, thou; and
<i>wemo</i>, <i>waymo</i>, <i>hamo</i>, or <i>ámata</i>, he. The first person of
the pronoun is always omitted, except with the verb to
be, and the second and third persons frequently. Pronominal
adjectives are quite irregular, as <i>owkey</i>, from
<i>ah</i>; <i>maykey</i>, from <i>ama</i>; <i>wébakey</i>, from <i>wemo</i>; and they
are also used irregularly with nouns. Thus in <i>medde</i>,
father; <i>ahmen</i>, or <i>owkáhmen</i>, or <i>áhmedde</i>, being equivalent
to I father, my father. Here, also, euphony steps
in and makes words sometimes wholly unrecognizable, as
<i>ahtótána</i>, equivalent to <i>méhand</i>, and still more different,
as <i>mamówky</i>, this is for me. Your father is <i>máykemay</i>;
his father, <i>wébamen</i>. Thus it will be seen that <i>medde</i> is
changed, or abbreviated, into <i>men</i>, and <i>may</i>. Sometimes
the personal pronoun is agglutinated to the verb, and
sometimes it is not;&mdash;<i>chechoánomdo</i> (<i>chechoána meto</i>),
I strike you; <i>meto tudáwa</i>, I love you. As in many
other Pacific States languages, we have here a reverential
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_646">646</a></span>
syllable, which in this language is always prefixed,
whereas in others, for instance the Aztec, it is an affix.
Speaking of persons related, or of things belonging, to
the chief, the reverential <i>me</i> or <i>jin</i>, is always prefixed;&mdash;<i>owkeybaì</i>,
my wife; <i>maykeybaì</i>, your wife; <i>atópte
meëtchen</i>, the chief's wife; <i>shinna</i>, head; <i>metoshin</i>, your
head; <i>webashin</i>, his head; <i>atópte jinshinna</i>, the chief's
head. All adjectives are really substantives, and are
used for both purposes. Thus, <i>ootu</i>, boy, also signifies
little, or young. Adjectives are generally placed after
nouns&mdash;<i>majey codey</i>, good day; but there are also many
exceptions to this rule. Comparatives are expressed by
the particle <i>pala</i>, more;&mdash;<i>paleyabáta waymo ahmet</i>, he is
greater than I, <i>pala</i> becoming <i>paléya</i>, in composition.
This is only used by the more intelligent class. A
Gallinomero of the lower order would say, <i>bata waymo
ahmet</i>, great he I. The principal characteristics of the
language are euphony and brevity, to which all things
else are subservient, but nevertheless, as I have shown
already, agglutination is carried to the farthest extent.<a id="FNanchor_IVp-14" href="#Footnote_IVp-14" class="fnanchor">[IV'-14]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">TRANS-PACIFIC COMPARISONS.</p>

<p>As will be seen by the following comparative table,
the Pomo language, or rather one of its dialects, the
Kulanapo, shows some affinity to the Malay family of
languages. Of one hundred and seventy words which I
have compared, I find fifteen per cent. showing Malay
similarities, and more could perhaps have been found if
the several vocabularies had been made upon some one
system. As it is, I have been obliged to use a Malay, a
Tonga, and other Polynesian vocabularies, taken by different
persons, at different times. Without attempting to
establish any relationship between the Polynesians and
Californians, I present these similarities merely as a
fact; these analogies I find existing nowhere else in California,
and between them and no other Trans-Pacific
peoples.<a id="FNanchor_IVp-15" href="#Footnote_IVp-15" class="fnanchor">[IV'-15]</a></p>

<p>The similarities existing between the Japanese and
Chinese, and the Californian languages, appearing from
a careful comparison of the same one hundred and

the few resemblances may be regarded as purely
accidental. Of these words I insert the following,
which are all between which I have been able to discover
any likeness:</p>

<p>The Choweshak and Batemdakaiee are mentioned as
being spoken at the head of Eel River, and the Chocuyem
in Marin County, near the Mission of San
Rafael. On Russian River, there yet remain to be
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_648">648</a></span>
mentioned the Olamentke, and the Chwachamaju. All
these may be properly classed as dialects nearly related
to the Pomo family, and some of them may even be the
same dialects under different names.<a id="FNanchor_IVp-16" href="#Footnote_IVp-16" class="fnanchor">[IV'-16]</a></p>

<p>Of the Chocuyem I give the following Lord's Prayer:</p>

<p>Api maco su lilecoe, ma nénas mi aués omai mácono
mi taucuchs oyópa mi tauco chaquenit opú neyatto
chaquenit opu liletto. Tu maco muye genum ji naya

ma suli mayaco. Macoi yangia ume omutto, ulémi
mácono omu incapo. Nette esa Jesus.<a id="FNanchor_IVp-17" href="#Footnote_IVp-17" class="fnanchor">[IV'-17]</a></p>

<p>In Round Valley, northern California, there is the
before-mentioned Yuka language, which is connected
with the Wapo, or Ashochemie, spoken near Calistoga,
and in the mountains leading thence to the Geysers.<a id="FNanchor_IVp-18" href="#Footnote_IVp-18" class="fnanchor">[IV'-18]</a></p>

<p>On Yuba and Feather rivers are the Meidoos and
Neeshenams of whose language Powers says that "the
Meidoo shades away so gradually into the Neeshenam
that it is extremely difficult to draw a line anywhere.
But it must be drawn somewhere, because a vocabulary
taken down on Feather River will lose three fourths of
its words before it reaches the Cosumnes. Even a vocabulary
taken on Bear River will lose half or more of its
words in going to the Cosumnes, which denotes, as is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_649">649</a></span>
the fact, that the Neeshenam language varies greatly
within itself. Indeed, it is probably less homogeneous
and more thronged with dialects than any other tongue
in California. Let an Indian go even from Georgetown
to American Flat, or from Bear River to Auburn, and,
with the exception of the numerals he will not at first
understand above one word in four, or five, or six. But,
with this small stock in common, and the same laws of
grammar to guide them, they pick up each others dialects
with amazing rapidity. It is these wide variations
which have caused some pioneers to believe that there
is one tongue spoken on the plains around Sacramento,
and another in the mountains; whereas they are as
nearly identical as the mountain dialects are. So long
as the numerals remain the same, I count it one language;
and so long as this is the case, the Indians generally
learn each others dialects; but when the numerals
change utterly, they often find it easier to speak the
English together than to acquire another tongue. As
to the southern boundary of the Neeshenam there is no
doubt, for at the Cosumnes the language changes abruptly
and totally."</p>

<p class="sidenote">LANGUAGES OF THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY.</p>

<p>Along the banks of the Sacramento, two distinct linguistic
systems are said to prevail. But to what extent
all the languages mentioned in that vicinity are related,
or can be classified, it is difficult to say; for not only is
there great confusion in names, but what is more essential,
vocabularies of most of them are wanting. On the
eastern bank of the Sacramento and extending along
Feather River, the Cosumnes, and other tributaries of
the Sacramento, the following languages are mentioned:
Ochecamne, Serouskumne, Chupumne, Omochumne, Siecumne,
Walagumne, Cosumne, Sololumne, Turealumne,
Saywamine, Newichumne, Matchemne, Sagayayumne,
Muthelemne, Sopotatumne, and Talatiu. In all these
dialects the word for water is <i>kik</i>, but in the dialects
spoken on the west bank it is <i>mómi</i>. On the western
bank are mentioned the dialects of the Pujuni, Puzlumne,
Secumne, Tsamak, Yasumne, Nemshaw, Kisky, Yalesumne,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_650">650</a></span>
Huk, and others.<a id="FNanchor_IVp-19" href="#Footnote_IVp-19" class="fnanchor">[IV'-19]</a> Undoubtedly all these Sacramento
Valley dialects are more or less related, but of
them we have no positive knowledge except that the
Secumne and Tsamak are closely related, while the
Puzlumne and Talatiu also show many words in common,
but cannot be said to affiliate.<a id="FNanchor_IVp-20" href="#Footnote_IVp-20" class="fnanchor">[IV'-20]</a> In the mountains
south of the Yuba, and also on some parts of the Sacramento
the Cushna language obtains. On the latter
river Wilkes mentions the Kinkla, of which he says
that in comparison with the language of the northern
nations it may be called soft, "as much so as that of the
Polynesians." Repetitions of syllables appear to be frequent
as <i>wai-wai</i>, and <i>hau-hau-hau</i>.<a id="FNanchor_IVp-21" href="#Footnote_IVp-21" class="fnanchor">[IV'-21]</a> In Napa Valley
six dialects were spoken, the Myacoma, Calayomane,
Caymus, Napa, Uluka, and Suscol.<a id="FNanchor_IVp-22" href="#Footnote_IVp-22" class="fnanchor">[IV'-22]</a> In Solano County
the Guiluco language was spoken, of which the following
Lord's Prayer may serve as a specimen:</p>

<p>Allá igamé mutryocusé mi zahuá om mi yahuatail
cha usqui etra shou mur tzecali ziam pac onjinta mul
zhaiíge nasoyate chelegua mul znatzoitze tzecali zicmatan
zchiitiilaa chalehua mesqui pihuatzite yteima omahuá.
Emqui Jesus.<a id="FNanchor_IVp-23" href="#Footnote_IVp-23" class="fnanchor">[IV'-23]</a></p>

<p>Near the straits of Karquines, and also in the San
Joaquin and Tulare valleys, the Tulare tongue prevailed.
In this language, if we may believe M. Duflot de Mofras,
the letters <i>b</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>g</i>, and <i>r</i> do not exist, the <i>r</i> being
changed into <i>l</i>, as <i>maria</i>, <i>malia</i>. Many guttural sounds
like <i>kh</i>, <i>tsh</i>, <i>lm</i>, <i>tp</i>, <i>tsp</i>, <i>th</i>, etc., are found, yet softer than
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_651">651</a></span>
the gutturals of the north. Notwithstanding the above
statement M. de Mofras gives as a specimen of the
Tulare language the following Lord's Prayer, in which
the <i>r</i> frequently occurs:</p>

<p>Appa macquen erinigmo tasunimac emracat, jinnin
eccey macquen iunisínmac macquen quitti éné soteyma
erinigmo: sumimac macquen hamjamú jinnan guara

equetmini em men.</p>

<p class="sidenote">SPECIMENS OF SOUTHERN LANGUAGES.</p>

<p>Of the languages spoken at the mission of Santa Inez
the following Lord's Prayer is given by M. de Mofras;
and this is very likely in the true Tulare language in
place of the one above.</p>

<p>Dios caquicoco upalequen alapa, quiaenicho opte: paquininigug
quique eccuet upalacs huatahuc itimisshup
caneche alapa. Ulamuhu ilahulalisahue. Picsiyug

utic lex ulechop santequiyug ilautechop. Amen Jesus.<a id="FNanchor_IVp-24" href="#Footnote_IVp-24" class="fnanchor">[IV'-24]</a></p>

<p>The Tulare language is probably the same which was
known under the name of Kahweyah in central California
and may have some connection with the Cahuillo in
the southern part of the state.<a id="FNanchor_IVp-25" href="#Footnote_IVp-25" class="fnanchor">[IV'-25]</a></p>

<p>Languages in the interior, of which but little more
than the name and the region where they were spoken
is known, are, on the Tuolumne River the Hawhaw and
another which has no particular name; on the Merced
River the Coconoon with a dialect extending to King
River and to Tulare Lake.<a id="FNanchor_IVp-26" href="#Footnote_IVp-26" class="fnanchor">[IV'-26]</a> Mr Powers makes of the
tribes inhabiting Kern and Tulare valleys the Yocut nation,
<i>yocut</i> signifying an aggregation of people, while
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_652">652</a></span>
<i>myee</i>, or <i>nono</i>, means man. "It is a singular fact," observes
this writer, "that in several of the northern languages
<i>kiya</i> denotes dog, while in the Yocut, <i>kiya</i> is
coyote."</p>

<p>From Mr Powers I have also the following vocabularies,
which have never before been published.</p>

<p>Information regarding the languages spoken where
the city of San Francisco now stands, and throughout
the adjacent country, is meagre, and of a very indefinite
character. On the shores of San Francisco Bay,
there are the languages spoken by the Matalans, Salses,
and Quirotes, which are dialects of one mother language.<a id="FNanchor_IVp-27" href="#Footnote_IVp-27" class="fnanchor">[IV'-27]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_653">653</a></span>
This language has by some been called the Olhone, and
although other dialects are mentioned as belonging to it,
it is generally stated that but one general language was
spoken by all of them.<a id="FNanchor_IVp-28" href="#Footnote_IVp-28" class="fnanchor">[IV'-28]</a> Southward, near Monterey,
there are more positive data. Here we find as the principal
languages, the two spoken by the Runsiens and
Eslenes; besides which, the Ismuracan and Aspianaque
are mentioned.<a id="FNanchor_IVp-29" href="#Footnote_IVp-29" class="fnanchor">[IV'-29]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">DIALECTS OF THE RUNSIEN AND ESLENE.</p>

<p>But although they are called distinct languages,
Taylor affirms that the Eslenes, Sakhones, Chalones,
Katlendarukas, Poytoquis, Mutsunes, Thamiens, and
many others, spoke different dialects of the Runsien language,
and that over a stretch of country one hundred and
seventy miles in length, the natives were all able to converse
with greater or less facility with each other, and that
although "their dialects were infinitesimal and puzzling,
their vocal communications were intelligible enough
when brought together at the different missions." La
Pérouse's Achastliens and Ecclemachs are probably
nothing more than other names for some of the above-mentioned
dialects.<a id="FNanchor_IVp-30" href="#Footnote_IVp-30" class="fnanchor">[IV'-30]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_654">654</a></span></p>

<p>Not only do all these before-mentioned languages show
a relationship one with another, but there are faint
resemblances detected between them and the Olhone
language of San Francisco Bay. Furthermore, between
the latter and the language spoken at La Soledad Mission,
as well as that of the Olamentkes of Russian River, which
I have already classed with the Pomo family, there are
faint traces of relationship.<a id="FNanchor_IVp-31" href="#Footnote_IVp-31" class="fnanchor">[IV'-31]</a></p>

<p>A further confirmation of this relationship is found in
the statement of the first missionary Fathers, who
traveled overland from Monterey to San Francisco, and
who, although at that time totally unacquainted with
these languages, recognized resemblances in certain
words.<a id="FNanchor_IVp-32" href="#Footnote_IVp-32" class="fnanchor">[IV'-32]</a> The dialect spoken at the Mission of Santa
Clara has been preserved to us only in the shape of the
Lord's Prayer which follows:</p>

<p>Adjectives are declined the same as substantives when
they are declined alone; but they differ in their declension
from substantives when they are declined in
connection with them, because then they do not change
their terminations, but remain the same in all the cases.
The rules of syntax are intricate and very difficult.</p>

<p>Father Comelias speaks of a language at the Mission
of Santa Cruz, with numerous dialects, in fact so many,
that the language changed nearly every two leagues, and
being at times so divergent, that it was with difficulty
neighboring people could understand one another.<a id="FNanchor_IVp-34" href="#Footnote_IVp-34" class="fnanchor">[IV'-34]</a> In
the vicinity of the Mission San Antonio de Padua, there
is a language which has been variously named, Tatché,
Telamé, and Sextapay. It appears to be a distinct
language, and Taylor affirms that the people speaking
it could not understand those of La Soledad Mission, thirty
miles north.<a id="FNanchor_IVp-35" href="#Footnote_IVp-35" class="fnanchor">[IV'-35]</a> In this language the letters <i>b</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>r</i>, do
not appear; <i>na</i> expresses the article the, and also this.
There are many different ways of expressing the plural
of nouns. Some add the syllable <i>il</i>, <i>el</i>, <i>l</i>, or <i>li</i>, others
insert <i>ti</i>, or <i>t</i>, while others again add <i>leg</i>, <i>aten</i>, <i>ten</i>, or
<i>teno</i>, as may be seen in the following examples.<a id="FNanchor_IVp-36" href="#Footnote_IVp-36" class="fnanchor">[IV'-36]</a></p>

<p>Cases do not appear to exist, the relations of the nouns
being expressed by particles. Adjectives do not vary to
show gender or degree. Personal pronouns are usually
copulative and included in the verb, whether subjective
or objective. Of the use of the possessive pronoun
the following examples will give the clearest idea:
Brother, <i>citolo</i>; my brother, <i>cítol</i>; thy brother, <i>e<sup>a</sup>tsmitol</i>;
brothers, <i>citolanélo</i>; my brothers, <i>citolanél</i>; thy brothers,
<i>e<sup>a</sup>tsmitolanel</i>; mother, <i>epjo</i>; thy mother, <i>petsmipeg</i>; house,
<i>ch<sup>v</sup>iconou</i>; my house, <i>ch<sup>v</sup>ícono<sup>v</sup></i>; thy house, <i>zimch<sup>v</sup>icono</i>;

<p class="sidenote">SAN MIGUEL AND SANTA CRUZ VOCABULARY.</p>

<p>Another distinct language is found at and near the
Mission of San Miguel, but of it nothing but a short
vocabulary taken by Mr Hale is known. The language
spoken at San Gabriel and at San Fernando Rey, called
Kizh, and the Netela used at San Juan Capistrano, I
shall not describe here, but include them with the Shoshone
family, to which they are related. The Chemehuevi
and Cahuillo I also place among the Shoshone dialects,
while the Diegeño and Comeya will be included in
the Yuma family. It therefore only remains for me to
speak of the languages of the islands near the coast of
California. Of these, the principal, or mother language,
was spoken on the island of Santa Cruz. The different
tribes inhabiting the various islands all spoke dialects of
one language, which was somewhat guttural. I insert
a short vocabulary of the Santa Cruz Island language
with that of the Mission of San Miguel.</p>

</p>

<p>In this chapter I include all the languages of the
Shoshone family, the Wihinasht or western Shoshone
of Idaho and Oregon, the Utah with its many dialects,
the Comanche or Yetan of Texas and New Mexico, the
Moqui of Arizona, the Kizh, Netela, and Kechi of the
San Fernando Mission, and their dialects, and the Cahuillo
and Chemehuevi of south-eastern California. The
six last mentioned do not properly belong to the Shoshone
family, but on account of certain faint traces of
Aztec, found alike in them and in all Shoshone idioms,
I cannot do better than to speak of them in this connection.
As regards this Aztec element, I do not mean to
say that these languages are related to the Aztec language,
in the same sense that other languages are spoken of as
being related to each other, for this might lead those
who are searching for the former habitation or fatherland
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_661">661</a></span>
of the Aztecs, to suppose that it has been found. This
element consists simply in a number of words, identical
or reasonably approximate to the like Aztec words, and
in the similarity, perhaps, of a few grammatical rules.
How this Aztec word-material crept into the languages
of the Shoshones, whether by intercommunication, or
Aztec colonization, we do not know. Nor do I wish to be
understood as attempting to sustain the popular theory
of an Aztec migration from the north; on the contrary,
the evidence of language is all on the other side.
Whether or not the Great Basin, or any part of the
Northwest, was once occupied by the ancient Mexicans,
it is certain that the Aztec language, as a base, is found
nowhere north of central Mexico, so that these incidental
or accidental word-analogies if they prove anything,
indicate only a scattering from some primeval centre,
other than the place where they are found, and tend to
show that the language whose words are thus thinly
sprinkled over so broad an area, could not have been
the aboriginal stock language of the country.</p>

<p class="sidenote">SHOSHONE AND UTAH DIALECTS.</p>

<p>The Shoshone and the Utah are the principal languages
of the great interior basin; and these may be regarded
as sisters of a common mother language, the
Shoshone preponderating. Each has many dialects.
The Shoshone language may be divided into eastern, or
Shoshone proper, and western Shoshone, or Wihinasht.
Of the former the Bannack, and the Digger, or Shoshokee,
are the chief variations. The Utah dialects, more
numerous, are the Goshute, Washoe, Paiulee, Piute,
Sampitche, Mono, and a few others, which latter vary so
little from some one of the others, that it is unnecessary
to trace them as separate dialects. The Comanche dialects
I shall not attempt to classify.<a id="FNanchor_Vp-1" href="#Footnote_Vp-1" class="fnanchor">[V'-1]</a> No grammar has
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_662">662</a></span>
ever been written of any of these languages. In all of
them words are generally accented on the first syllable,
except when a possessive pronoun is prefixed. Words
of more than four syllables, generally have a secondary
accent on the fifth, as in <i>té-ith-tis-chi-hó-no</i>, valley.<a id="FNanchor_Vp-2" href="#Footnote_Vp-2" class="fnanchor">[V'-2]</a> A
few words in these languages are found almost identical
with like words of the Tinneh family, which have
probably found their way into them by intercommunication.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_663">663</a></span>
Of these the following are the principal ones,
so far as designated by existing vocabularies:</p>

great; long words are also not infrequent, like <i>pimatiyimwaiákin</i>,
salt.<a id="FNanchor_Vp-4" href="#Footnote_Vp-4" class="fnanchor">[V'-4]</a> A short comparative vocabulary to
show the connection between these languages, is given
further on.</p>

<p class="sidenote">AZTEC TRACES NORTH OF MEXICO.</p>

<p>Let us now consider the often discussed but ill understood
question of the Aztec language in the north.
Torquemada and Vetancvrt narrate the expedition of
Juan de Oñate, who invaded New Mexico during the
last years of the sixteenth century. Father Roque de
Figueredo, who accompanied the expedition, says that
while searching for a lost mule, at the Rio del Tizon,
the Mexican muleteers met certain natives who addressed
them in their own language, and who, on
being asked whence they came, answered that they
came from the north, where that language was spoken.
Clavigero, who repeats the above, also asserts, that
during the expedition made by the Spaniards, in
1606, to New Mexico, when north of the Rio del Tizon,
they saw some large houses, and near them certain natives
who spoke the Mexican language. Then we have
the statement of Father Gerónimo de Zárate, that while
searching for the Laguna de Copala, he was informed,
among other things, that the country in its vicinity was
densely peopled by men who spoke a language similar to
that of his Aztec servants. Zárate was at this time at
the Rio del Tizon, and the natives, who are close observers
in such matters, assured the Spaniards that they
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_664">664</a></span>
detected in the speech of the servant certain words
common to both his own and the language of the people
of the Laguna de Copala. And again, in the region
toward the east, Acosta says that "of late they have
discovered a new land, which they call New Mexico,
where they say is much people that speake the Mexican
tongue."</p>

<p>Vater, in his Mithridates, intimates that the Mexican
language spread far northward, through the roamings of
wild tribes, particularly the Chichimecs; but when we
remember that the term Chichimec was applied by the
early Spaniards to all the immense unknown nomadic
hordes north and west, this mention carries with it but
little weight. Mr Anderson, who accompanied Captain
Cook to the north-west coast, in 1778, fancied he detected
a resemblance between the Aztec and the language
of the Nootkas. "From the few Mexican words," he
says, "I have been able to procure, there is the most obvious
agreement, in the very frequent terminations of
the vowels in <i>l</i>, <i>tl</i>, or <i>z</i>, throughout the language." And
remarks the editor, "may we not, in confirmation of Mr.
Anderson's remark, observe, that Opulszthl, the Nootka
name of the Sun; and Vitziputzli, the name of the Mexican
Divinity, have no very distant affinity in sound."
Now the absurdity of all idle speculations is apparent
when we encounter such far-fetched comparisons as
this. In the first place, there is no affinity in the sounds
of the two words, and in the next place there is no
such Aztec god&mdash;Huitzilopochtli probably being the god
meant. Neither has this last word any resemblance to
the sun; it is composed of the two words, <i>huitzilin</i>, an
abbreviation of the Mexican <i>huitzitzilin</i>, which signifies
'humming-bird,' and <i>opochtli</i>, that is to say 'left.' Vater
also draws analogies between the Aztec and the Nootka,
and Ugalenze, which on close comparison do not hold
good.</p>

<p>Regarding the affinity of the Aztec language with
those of the Pueblos, Moquis, Apaches, Yumas, and
others of New Mexico and Arizona, Ruxton ventures
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_665">665</a></span>
the assertion, "all these speak dialects of the same language....
They likewise all understand each other's
tongue. What relation this language bears to the
Mexican is unknown; but my impression is, that it
will be found to assimilate greatly, if not to be identical,"&mdash;in
all of which assertions Mr Ruxton is greatly
in error.</p>

<p>All this, as evidence, does not amount to much; it
only indicates the origin of a popular belief which placed
a Mexican language in various parts of the north, while
at the same time it shows upon how slender a thread
hangs this belief, and how the vaguest traditionary rumors
come, by repetition, to be accredited as fixed
facts.</p>

<p>Buschmann asks himself the question whether the
Aztec words, in any considerable number, are not found
in any other languages of the great Mexican empire&mdash;in
the Zapotec, Miztec, Tarasco, Otomí, or Huastec&mdash;and the
answer is no; he has discovered a few accidental word-similarities,
such as may be found between the Aztec
and other American languages, or between any two languages
of the world, but nothing which, by any possibility,
could denote relationship.</p>

<p>From another class of evidence we approach a little
nearer the truth. Andres Perez de Ribas, missionary
to Sinaloa writing about 1640, says, that while studying
the language of his people, he noticed many Mexican
words particularly radicals, and also words which appeared
to have been originally Mexican, but which had
been so altered that only one or two syllables in them
could be recognized as Aztec.</p>

<p>Father Ortega, in 1732, wrote a vocabulary of the
Cora language, in which he says, the people had incorporated
in their language many words of the Mexican
and some few of the Spanish languages, and this at a
period so early that at the time of his writing they
were regarded as belonging to the original language.</p>

<p>Hervas, whose work appeared in 1787, says that the
Tarahumara language is full of Mexican words. Vater,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_666">666</a></span>
writing early in the nineteenth century, affirms that the
Cora is remarkable for its relation to the Mexican, and
that the Tarahumara, which is a more polished language
than its neighbors, contains some words similar to the
Aztec. In his Mithridates, Vater notices a relationship
between the Cora and the Aztec, furthermore asserting
that the conjugations of the two are so alike as plainly
to prove the connection.</p>

<p>Wilhelm von Humboldt left us a short manuscript
grammar of the Cora and Tarahumara, in which he remarks
that for languages which are related, the Cora
and the Mexican have great differences in their sound-systems,
and although these two languages certainly appear
to be related, yet he is unwilling to assert that
either is derived from the other. "There are more
ways than one," says the great philologist Wilhelm von
Humboldt, "by which languages are connected. The
impression left upon me by the Cora, is that it is a mixture
of two different languages: one the Mexican, and
the other some older and richer language, but rougher.
In the grammar of the Cora there are found very many
forms which strikingly call to mind the Mexican, yet at
the same time there are many forms wholly different,
made by rules directly opposite, among which are the
pronouns." He further remarks two other important
differences between the Cora and the Mexican which
are the absence of the reduplication of syllables and of
the reverential forms.</p>

<p>Such was the attitude of the subject when Mr Buschmann
took it up. From the prevailing impression of an
Aztec origin in the north, but more particularly from
certain remarks of Alexander von Humboldt concerning
the probable passing of the ancient Mexicans through
the regions of the north, he set himself to work to find
this line of migration, and the exact relations of their
language in various parts. Commencing at the
Valley of Mexico he made a careful analysis of every
western language north of that place of which he could
obtain any material. The result of Mr Buschmann's
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_667">667</a></span>
researches was the discovery of Aztec traces in certain
parts, but nowhere did he find the Aztec language as a
base.</p>

<p class="sidenote">AZTEC TRACES IN NORTHERN MEXICO.</p>

<p>More particularly were these Aztec words and word-analogies
perceptible in four certain languages of north-western
Mexico; in the Cora, spoken in the Nayarit district
of Jalisco, commencing about fifteen leagues from
the coast at the mouth of the Rio Tololotlan, and extending
between the parallels 21°30' and 20° back irregularly
into the interior about twenty leagues; in the
Tepehuana of northern Sinaloa, northern Durango, and
southern Chihuahua, or as laid down on the map of
Orozco y Berra, commencing near the twenty-third
parallel about twenty leagues from the eastern shore of
the Gulf of California, and extending over a horse-shoe
shaped territory to about the twenty-seventh parallel; in
the Tarahumara spoken immediately north of the Tepehuana
in the states of Chihuahua and Sonora, in the
centre of the Sierra Madre; and lastly in the Cahita
spoken by the people inhabiting the eastern shore of the
Gulf of California, between latitude 26° and 28° north,
and extending back from the coast irregularly about
forty leagues, being almost directly west of the Tarahumara,
though not exactly contiguous. The name Cahita
is applied by the missionaries only to the language, and
not to the people speaking it. In the license prefixed
to the <i>Manual para administrar à los Indios del idioma
Cahita los santos sacramentos compuesto por un Sacerdote
de la Compañia de Jesus</i>, printed in Mexico in 1740, it is
called the common language of the missions of the province
of Sinaloa, spoken by the Yaquis and the Mayos, the
latter extending far into southern Sonora. In a vocabulary
of the Cahita given by Ternaux-Compans, in the
<i>Nouvelles Annales</i>, there are likewise found many Aztec
words. Neither of these languages are related to the
others, yet in all of them is a sprinkling of Aztec word-material.
The Aztec substantive ending <i>tl</i> and <i>tli</i>, in
the Cora are found changed in <i>ti</i>, <i>te</i>, and <i>t</i>; in the Tepehuana
into <i>de</i>, <i>re</i>, and <i>sci</i>; in the Tarahumara into <i>ki</i>, <i>ke</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_668">668</a></span>
<i>ca</i>, and <i>la</i>; and in the Cahita, into <i>ri</i>. In all four of
the languages substantive endings are dropped, first,
in composition when the substantive is united with the
possessive pronoun; secondly, before an affix; thirdly, in
the Cora alone, before the ending of the plural; and
before affixes in the formation of words. They are not
dropped in verbs derived from substantives; and when
two substantives are combined to form a word the
Aztec terminal is dropped in the first, and also in the
combination of a substantive and verb.</p>

<p>In the Cora, the ending <i>tyahta</i> has the same meaning
as the Aztec local ending <i>tla</i>, or <i>tlan</i>, which signifies the
locality of a thing; as, <i>acotn</i>, a fir-tree; (Aztec, <i>ocotl</i>)
<i>ocotyahta</i>, a fir-forest; (Aztec, <i>ocotlan</i>). Another striking
similarity between these four languages and the Aztec
consists in the use of a postfix in the formation of substantives
of locality and names of places. Then come
the numerals, in which are found similarities in all their
formations. The Aztec verb <i>ca</i>, to be, and even its
irregular branch, <i>catqui</i>, is found disseminated throughout
all these languages. In the Tarahumara dictionary
of Steffel, and in the Cora dictionary of Ortega, Buschmann
found the Aztec element even stronger than he
had supposed, and he wondered how Gallatin, who had
Tellechea's grammar, could have allowed these similarities
to escape his observations.</p>

<p class="sidenote">AZTEC MATERIAL IN THE AZTEC-SONORA FAMILY.</p>

<p>Of these four languages Buschmann makes what he
calls his Sonora family; which term is somewhat a misnomer
as applied to languages not related, and spoken
more without than within the province of Sonora. Their
only bond of union is this Aztec element, which may
have found its way into them at different times and
under different circumstances. The most peculiar feature
of it all, is the departure which is made by these
Aztec-Sonora languages, as from an original centre,
and their several appearance, each stamped alike with
Aztec marks while at the same time sustaining its own
individuality, in different parts of the great northern
regions. It is as though a handful of Aztec words had
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_669">669</a></span>
been thrown, at intervals, into the languages of each of
these four peoples, and, after partial amalgamations
of these foreign words with those of the aboriginal
tongues, by some means the words so modified had found
their way in greater or less quantities into the languages
of other and remote tribes. It is at such times,
when we obtain a glance from a distance at their
shadowy history, that there arise in the mind visions of
their illimitable unwritten past, and of the mighty turmoils
and revolutions which must forever remain as
they are, shrouded in the deepest mystery.</p>

<p>In these four Aztec-Sonora languages there are nearly
two hundred Aztec words, and the words derived from
them by the respective native idioms into which they
were projected, swell the list to four times that number;
and these, with other pure Aztec words in every stage
of mutilation and transformation are found re-scattered
throughout the before-mentioned Pueblo, Shoshone, and
other languages of the north. But again, let me say,
nowhere does the Aztec, or any of its affiliations appear
as a base north of central Mexico.<a id="FNanchor_Vp-5" href="#Footnote_Vp-5" class="fnanchor">[V'-5]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_670">670</a></span></p>

<p>Taking into consideration that some Aztec and Shoshone
words are almost identical, and that the endings
of others are almost exactly alike, it is not surprising
if the acute ear of the natives detected phonetic
resemblances. The connection between these languages
may not be in one respect as positive as that between
the languages which compose the great Aryan family
on the Asiatic and European continents, but, on the
other hand, it presents a somewhat analogous system, by
means of which it becomes possible to establish a connection.
I allude to Mr Grimm's discovery of what has
been termed '<i>Lautverschiebung</i>,' or '<i>Lautveränderung</i>,'
anglicé 'Sound-shunting.'<a id="FNanchor_Vp-6" href="#Footnote_Vp-6" class="fnanchor">[V'-6]</a></p>

<p>This phenomenon consists of the changing, or shunting,
of certain vowels or consonants in the words of one language,
into certain other vowels and consonants in the
same words of another language; and this not accidentally,
but in accordance with fixed rules. Sound-shunting,
originally discovered by Mr Grimm in the Aryan
tongues, has also been found by Mr Buschmann in the
languages of his Sonora family, where it is more particularly
prominent in the word-endings. In a subsequent
place I shall have occasion to refer again to this
point, and particularly when speaking of the North
Mexican languages, the Tarahumara, Tepehuana, Cora,
and Cahita, where it can be clearly shown by comparison
with the Aztec, that such shunting, or changing, has
taken place. In the languages at present under consideration,
the Shoshone, Utah, and Comanche, we have
this shunting system illustrated in the substantives and
adjective endings <i>p</i>, <i>pa</i>, <i>pe</i>, <i>pi</i>, <i>be</i>, <i>wa</i>, <i>ph</i>, <i>pee</i>, <i>rp</i>, and <i>rpe</i>;
and more particularly in the Utah and Shoshone <i>ts</i>, <i>tse</i>,
<i>tsi</i>, all of which may be referred to the Aztec endings <i>tl</i>,
<i>tli</i>, and others. In the last-mentioned case the endings
have been preserved in a purer form, while in the former
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_671">671</a></span>
the shunting or changing law is observed. As illustrating
the connection between the languages under consideration
and those before mentioned of Sonora and
through them with the Aztec, I append on the next page
a short vocabulary in which the similarities can be easily
observed.<a id="FNanchor_Vp-7" href="#Footnote_Vp-7" class="fnanchor">[V'-7]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE MOQUI LANGUAGE.</p>

<p>The Moqui, as before observed, does not properly belong
to the Shoshone family, but shows a connection
with the Aztec. It is strange that two permanently located
peoples, the Moquis and the Pueblos, both living
in well-built towns not far apart, and both showing signs
of a budding civilization, should speak languages totally
different from each other; that one of these languages
should show a connection with the Aztec and the other
not; that neither is related to the tongue of the Shoshones,
who nearly surround them; and, furthermore,
that in six of the seven Moqui towns only, the Moqui
language is spoken, while in the seventh, Harno, the
Tegua, a language of one of the New Mexican Pueblos is
spoken. The people of Harno can converse with the
Moquis of the six other towns, but among themselves
they never make use of the Moqui, always speaking the
Tegua.<a id="FNanchor_Vp-8" href="#Footnote_Vp-8" class="fnanchor">[V'-8]</a></p>

<p>No grammar has been written of the Moqui language,
and a few vocabularies are all we possess of it. Gov.
Lane, speaking of the Pueblo languages collectively, writes:
"All these languages are extremely guttural, and, to my
ear, seemed so much alike, that I imagine they have
sprung from the same parent stock."<a id="FNanchor_Vp-9" href="#Footnote_Vp-9" class="fnanchor">[V'-9]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">MOQUI AFFILIATIONS.</p>

<p>Some claim a relationship between the Moquis and
the Apaches and others, but no such connection has ever
been established.<a id="FNanchor_Vp-10" href="#Footnote_Vp-10" class="fnanchor">[V'-10]</a> The only positive statement in this
regard is made by Buschmann, who, by actual comparison
of vocabularies, has determined its status.<a id="FNanchor_Vp-11" href="#Footnote_Vp-11" class="fnanchor">[V'-11]</a> Among
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_674">674</a></span>
other connecting links he particularly mentions the substantive
endings <i>pe</i>, <i>be</i>, and others, by means of which, he
says, the Moqui attaches itself to the Shoshone-Comanche
branch of the Sonora idioms. The comparative vocabulary
before given will further illustrate their affiliation.<a id="FNanchor_Vp-12" href="#Footnote_Vp-12" class="fnanchor">[V'-12]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">KIZH AND NETELA SPECIMENS.</p>

<p class="p2">Returning to southern California, let us examine
the three languages, Kizh, Netela, and Kechi, spoken
near the missions of San Gabriel, San Juan Capistrano,
and San Luis Rey, respectively, which are not only
distantly related to each other, but show traces of the
Sonora-Aztec idioms. Father Boscana, who has left us
an accurate description of the natives at San Juan Capistrano,
unfortunately devoted little attention to their
language, and only gives us a few scattered words and
stanzas. One of the latter reads as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>Quic noit noivam</p>
<p>Quic secat peleblich</p>
<p>Ybicnum majaar vesagnec</p>
<p>Ibi panal, ibi urusar,</p>
<p>Ibi ecbal, ibi seja, ibi calcel.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Which may be rendered thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>I go to my home</p>
<p>That is shaded with willows.</p>
<p>These five they have placed,</p>
<p>This agave, this stone pot,</p>
<p>This sand, this honey, etc.<a id="FNanchor_Vp-13" href="#Footnote_Vp-13" class="fnanchor">[V'-13]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p>But very little is known of the grammatical structure
of these languages. In the Kizh, the plural is formed
in various ways, as may be seen in the following examples:</p>

<p>The Kizh appears also to have been spoken, in a
slightly divergent dialect, at the Mission of San Fernando,
as may be easily seen by comparing the following
two versions of the Lord's Prayer; the first in the language
of San Fernando, and the latter in that spoken
at San Gabriel.</p>

<p>Y yorac yona taray tucúpuma sagoucó motoanian

<p>In like manner do the Netela and Kechi show a close
affinity. The Netela Lord's Prayer reads:</p>

<p>Chana ech tupana ave onench, otune a cuachin,
chame om reino, libi yb chosonec esna tupána cham
nechetepe, micate tom cha chaom, pepsum yg cai caychame,

<p>The Kechi is as follows:</p>

<p>Although Mr Turner classed these languages with the
Shoshone family, in reality they only form such a tie
through their Sonora and Aztec connection.<a id="FNanchor_Vp-16" href="#Footnote_Vp-16" class="fnanchor">[V'-16]</a> This is
illustrated by Mr Buschmann in an extensive comparative
vocabulary of the three languages, of which I shall
give a brief extract on a subsequent page.<a id="FNanchor_Vp-17" href="#Footnote_Vp-17" class="fnanchor">[V'-17]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">CHEMEHUEVI AND CAHUILLO PRONOUNS.</p>

<p>The Chemehuevi and Cahuillo, the last two of this
division, have also been classed as belonging to the Shoshone
family, and some have even called them bands of
Pah-Utes, but what has been said concerning the affiliation
of the three last mentioned will apply to these with
equal force. That they are distinct languages has already
been stated by Padre Garcés, who describes them
under the name of Chemegue cajuala, Chemegue sebita,
Chemeguaba, and Chemegue, ascribing the same language
to all of them in distinction from their neighbors.
He includes with the Chemehuevi the Yavipai muca
oraive or Moqui, who, although not speaking the same
language, are still somewhat connected with them,
through their Sonora and Aztec relations, which conjectures
are singularly significant.<a id="FNanchor_Vp-18" href="#Footnote_Vp-18" class="fnanchor">[V'-18]</a> Grammatical remarks
on these languages there are but few to offer. The
accentuation is in neither very regular; in the Chemehuevi,
it is generally on the second syllable, while in the
Cahuillo it is mostly on the first.<a id="FNanchor_Vp-19" href="#Footnote_Vp-19" class="fnanchor">[V'-19]</a> I give here the
personal pronouns of the two languages.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />

LANGUAGES.</span></h2>

<p class="ch_summ">
<span class="smcap">Traces of the Aztec not found among the Pueblos of New Mexico and
Arizona&mdash;The Five Languages of the Pueblos, the Queres, the
Tegua, the Picoris, Jemez, and Zuñi&mdash;Pueblo Comparative Vocabulary&mdash;The

Noster in Three Cochimí Dialects&mdash;The Languages of Lower

</p>

<p>Having already mentioned some of the principal
idioms spoken in the southern part of the Great Basin,
as parts of the trunks to which they belong, or with
which they affiliate, I shall devote the present chapter
to such languages of New Mexico and Arizona as cannot
be brought into the Tinneh or Sonora stocks, and
to those of Lower California. Beginning with the
several tongues of the Pueblos, thence proceeding westward
to the Colorado River, and following its course
southward to the Gulf of California, I shall include
the languages of the southern extremity of California,
and finally those of the peninsula. These languages
are none of them cognate with any spoken in Mexico.
Respecting those of the Pueblos which have long been
popularly regarded as allied to southern tongues, it is
now very certain that they are in no wise related to
them, if we except the Aztec word-material found in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_681">681</a></span>
the Moqui. From analogous manners and customs,
from ancient traditions and time-honored beliefs, many
have claimed that these New Mexican towns-people are
the remains of aboriginal Aztec civilization, attempting
meanwhile to explain away the adverse testimony of
language, by amalgamation of the ancient tongue with
those of other nations, or by absorption or annihilation;
all of which, so far as arriving at definite conclusions
is concerned, amounts to nothing. Analogies
may be drawn between any nations of the earth;
human beings are not so unlike but that in every
community much may be found that is common
to other communities, irrespective of distance and
race, especially when the comparison is drawn
between two peoples both just emerging from savagism.
The facts before us concerning the Pueblo
languages are these: although all alike are well advanced
from primeval savagism, live in similar substantial
houses, and have many common customs, yet
their languages, though distinct as a whole from those
of the more savage surrounding tribes, do not agree
with each other. It is difficult to prove that the Aztec,
although now perhaps extinguished, never was the
tongue of New Mexico; on the other hand, it is impossible
to prove that it was, and surely theorists go
far out of their way in attempting to establish a people
in a land where no trace of their language exists, or
exists only in such a phase as proves conclusively that
it could not possibly have ever been the basis of the
language now spoken.</p>

<p class="sidenote">THE FIVE PUEBLO LANGUAGES.</p>

<p>Five distinct languages, with numerous dialects, more
or less deviating, are spoken by the Pueblos. By the
inhabitants of Santo Domingo, San Felipe, Santa Ana,
Silla, Laguna, Pojuate, Acoma, and Cochiti, the Queres
language is spoken; in San Juan, Santa Clara, San
Ildefonso, Pojuaque, Nambe, Tezuque, and also in Harno,
one of the Moqui towns, the Tegua language prevails;
in Taos, Picoris, Zandia, and Isleta, there is the Picoris
language; in Jemez and Old Pecos, the Jemez; in Zuñi,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_682">682</a></span>
the Zuñi language.<a id="FNanchor_VIp-1" href="#Footnote_VIp-1" class="fnanchor">[VI'-1]</a> The three principal dialects of
Queres are the Kiwomi, Cochitemi, and Acoma. Of
these the first two are very similar, in some cases almost
identical, while the Acoma is more distinct.<a id="FNanchor_VIp-2" href="#Footnote_VIp-2" class="fnanchor">[VI'-2]</a> In
the Queres the accent is almost invariably on the first
syllable, and the words are in general rather short,
although a few long words occur. Possessive pronouns
appear to be affixed; they are <i>ini</i>, <i>ni</i>, <i>ne</i>, <i>in</i>, and <i>i</i>.</p>

<p>In the Tegua and Zuñi the personal pronouns are:</p>

<p class="sidenote">COLORADO RIVER LANGUAGES.</p>

<p>In the region through which flows the Colorado, and
between that river and the Gila, many different languages
are mentioned by the early missionaries but at
this time it is difficult to ascertain how far different
names are applied to any one nation.</p>

<p>The missionaries themselves frequently did not know
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_684">684</a></span>
how to name the people; often they gave several names
to one language, and several languages one name; many
of the then existing dialects are known to have since
become extinct, and many more have mysteriously disappeared,
along with those who spoke them, so that in
many instances, a century after their first mention no
such language could be found. It seems seldom to have
occurred to the missionaries and conquerors that the
barbarous tongues of these heathen could ever be of interest
or value to Christendom, still less lists of their
words; so that vocabularies, almost the only valuable
speech-material of the philologist, are exceedingly rare
among the writings of the early missionary Fathers.
If one half of their profitless homilies on savage salvation
had been devoted to the simple gleaning of
facts, science would have been the gainer, and the souls
of the natives no whit less at peace. Of late, however,
vocabularies of the dialects of this region have become
numerous, and relationships are at length becoming
permanently established.</p>

<p>The languages under consideration, on comparison,
may nearly all be comprised in what may be called the
Yuma family. The principal dialects which constitute
the Yuma family are the Yuma, Maricopa, Cuchan,
Mojave, and Diegueño, which last is spoken in southern
California, and more particularly around the bay of
San Diego. Among others mentioned are the Yavipais
and Yampais.<a id="FNanchor_VIp-5" href="#Footnote_VIp-5" class="fnanchor">[VI'-5]</a> Compared with that of their neighbors
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_685">685</a></span>
the language of the Diegueños is soft and harmonious,
and as it contains all the sounds of the letters in the
English alphabet, the people speaking it readily learn
to pronounce the English and Spanish languages correctly.<a id="FNanchor_VIp-6" href="#Footnote_VIp-6" class="fnanchor">[VI'-6]</a>
The following Lord's Prayer is a specimen of
the dialect of the Diegueños.</p>

the Noche probably were the northern and eastern
neighbors of the Diegueños, and may have been mentioned
by some writers under other names. I have
preferred to enumerate them here, because the names
frequently occur in the reports of the earlier expeditions
to the Yuma nations.</p>

<p class="sidenote p2">THREE STOCK LANGUAGES IN LOWER CALIFORNIA.</p>

<p class="p2">On the peninsula of Lower California, there are
three distinct languages with many dialects, more or
less related to each other. Some of these dialects appear
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_687">687</a></span>
so remote from the parent stock that the early missionaries
believed them to be independent languages,
and accordingly the number of tongues on the peninsula
has been variously estimated, some saying four,
others six; but careful comparisons refer them all to
three stock languages. These are the Cochimí, with
its principal dialects, the Laymon and Ika; the Guaicuri,
with the Cora, Monqui, Didiú, Liyúe, Edú, and
Uchiti dialects; and lastly the Pericú. Besides the above,
there were also other dialectic differences in almost every
mission, such as the variations of word-endings, and other
minor points.<a id="FNanchor_VIp-14" href="#Footnote_VIp-14" class="fnanchor">[VI'-14]</a> In general these languages have been described
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_688">688</a></span>
as harsh and poverty-stricken. The missionaries
complained of not being able to find terms with
which to express many of the doctrines which they
wished to inculcate; but from the grammatical notes
left by Father Baegert and those of Ducrue contained
in <i>Murr's Nachrichten</i>, as well as from the various Pater
Nosters at hand, it appears that these languages are not
so very poor after all. Much there may have been
wanting to the zealous Fathers, many burning words
and soul-stirring expressions, which would have greatly
assisted their efforts, but except that there is certainly
no redundancy in these languages, they offer nothing
very extraordinary.<a id="FNanchor_VIp-15" href="#Footnote_VIp-15" class="fnanchor">[VI'-15]</a> Following I give a few grammatical
notes on the Guaicuri language. The sounds
represented by the German letters, <i>o</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>l</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>z</i>, and <i>s</i>,
excepting in <i>tsh</i>, do not appear. Possessive pronouns
are shown in the following examples:</p>

<p>Clavigero does not give a translation of this Lord's
Prayer, but Hervás, who copies it in his <i>Saggio Pratico</i>,
translates all words which he could find in a short
vocabulary; Buschmann and others copy from him,
and even at this time no complete translation is obtainable.</p>

<p>Lastly, I present a few sentences in the Laymon
dialect, literally translated.</p>

<p class="sidenote">THE CORA DIALECT IN LOWER CALIFORNIA.</p>

<p>None of the Lower Californian languages are in any
way related to, or connected with, any other language.
In Jalisco an idiom is spoken which is called the Cora,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_693">693</a></span>
but Señor Pimentel after comparing it with the Cora of
the peninsula as well as with others in Lower California,
assures us that not the least connection exists between
them.<a id="FNanchor_VIp-20" href="#Footnote_VIp-20" class="fnanchor">[VI'-20]</a> It has also been stated that the languages
spoken on the peninsula north of La Paz are affiliated
with the Yuma tongue, but this is not the case. As we
have seen, the dialect of the Diegueños reaches the seacoast
near San Diego, and again south of that point, and
this being a Yuma dialect, it has perhaps given rise to
the belief that the Lower Californian languages incline
the same way.<a id="FNanchor_VIp-21" href="#Footnote_VIp-21" class="fnanchor">[VI'-21]</a> In South America there is a language
called the Guaicuru, which has nothing in common with
the Guaicuri of Lower California.<a id="FNanchor_VIp-22" href="#Footnote_VIp-22" class="fnanchor">[VI'-22]</a></p>

<p>From the Rio Gila southward, in Sonora and in certain
parts of northern Sinaloa, is found the Pima language,
spoken in many dialects, of which the principal
divisions are the Pima alto and Pima bajo, or upper and
lower Pima, and it has generally been considered one of
the chief languages of northern Mexico. North of the
thirty-second parallel, the Pápago is the dominant dialect

the languages of their northern and southern neighbors
is represented as complete, full, and harmonious.<a id="FNanchor_VIIp-2" href="#Footnote_VIIp-2" class="fnanchor">[VII'-2]</a> Although
frequently classified with the Yuma, it is nevertheless
a distinct tongue. It is closely connected with
the Aztec-Sonora languages, which may be proven no
less by its grammatical coincidences, than by the similarity
of many of its words.<a id="FNanchor_VIIp-3" href="#Footnote_VIIp-3" class="fnanchor">[VII'-3]</a> Following is an extract
from a Pima grammar. The alphabet consists of the
following letters: <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>j</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>q</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>rh</i>,
<i>s</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>u</i>, <i>v</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>. Nearly all words end with a vowel.
To form the plural, the first syllable of the singular
noun is duplicated&mdash;<i>hota</i>, stone; <i>hohota</i>, stones. Exceptions
to this rule occur in some few cases;&mdash;<i>vinoy</i>, snake;
<i>vipinoy</i>, snakes; <i>tuaia</i>, girl; <i>tusia</i>, girls; <i>sisi</i>, brother;
<i>sisiki</i>, brothers; <i>tuvu</i>, hare; <i>tutuapa</i>, hares. Gender is
expressed by means of the words <i>ubi</i>, female, and <i>ituoti</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_696">696</a></span>
male. Derivatives expressing something which partakes
of the nature of the primitive are formed with the
affix <i>magui</i>;&mdash;<i>xaivori</i>, honey; <i>xaivorimaqui</i>, honeyed. For
the same purpose the terminal <i>kama</i> is also used;&mdash;<i>hadunikama</i>,
related to. <i>Kama</i> is also employed to form
names of places and patronymics. Abstract words are
formed with the word <i>daga</i>;&mdash;<i>humatkama</i>, man; <i>humatkamadaga</i>,
mankind; <i>stoa</i>, white; <i>stoadaga</i>, whiteness.
The particle <i>parha</i>, affixed to nouns implies a past condition;&mdash;<i>nigaga</i>,
my land for planting; <i>nigaga parha</i>, the
land for planting which was mine.</p>

<p>Verbs are divided into many classes, such as singular,
plural, frequentative, applicative, and compulsive.
Plural-verbs&mdash;<i>murha</i>, to run, one person; <i>vopobo</i>,
to run, many. Frequentatives are formed with
the verb <i>himu</i>, to go; for example, <i>vaita</i>, to call; <i>vaitahimu</i>,
to call frequently. Applicatives are made by
changing the terminal vowel of the verb into <i>i</i>, and
adding the terminal <i>da</i>&mdash;<i>tubanu</i>, to lower; <i>tubanida</i>, to
lower something. Compulsive verbs are formed with the
affix <i>tuda</i>&mdash;<i>hukiaridatuda</i>, to compel to count. A large
number of adverbs are used, of which I give only a few
specimens:</p>

<p>Substantives are generally placed after the adjectives.
To signify possession the name of the possessor is simply
prefixed&mdash;<i>Pedro onnigga</i>, wife of Pedro. Prepositions
are affixed.<a id="FNanchor_VIIp-4" href="#Footnote_VIIp-4" class="fnanchor">[VII'-4]</a> Of the different dialects there are
four specimens, of which one differs to such an extent
as to be hardly recognizable. Neither the names of
these dialects nor the places where they were spoken
are given with any of them by the authorities. The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_698">698</a></span>

<p>The next, a Lord's Prayer, is from a <i>Doctrina Christiana</i>:</p>

<p>The next is a Lord's Prayer from Hervás:</p>

<p>
T'oca titauacatum ami dacama; scuc amu aca mu

<p>The fourth, also a Lord's Prayer, is from the collection
of the Mexican Geographical Society:</p>

<p class="sidenote">THE DIALECTS OF THE ÓPATA LANGUAGE.</p>

<p>Wedged in between the Pima alto and the Pima
bajo, is the Ópata, or Teguima, with its principal dialect
the Eudeve. Although the Ópata and Eudeve have
generally been enumerated as distinct languages, after
careful comparison I think with the missionaries who
were conversant with both, that it will be safe to call
the one a dialect of the other. An anonymous author
even says that the difference between them is not
greater than between the Portuguese and Castilian, or
between the French and the Provençal.<a id="FNanchor_VIIp-6" href="#Footnote_VIIp-6" class="fnanchor">[VII'-6]</a> Like the
Pima, it is a branch of the Aztec-Sonora languages.
As is most frequent on the Pacific Coast, classification
differs greatly according to fancy; thus it is with the
Ópata; its classifications have been many, and among
others it has been placed with the Pima family. Many
dialects are mentioned, but little is said of them. Of
these there are the Teguis, Teguima, Coguinachi, Batuca,
Sahuaripa, Himeri, Guazaba, and Jova.<a id="FNanchor_VIIp-7" href="#Footnote_VIIp-7" class="fnanchor">[VII'-7]</a> The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_700">700</a></span>
Ópata is represented as finished, easy to acquire, and
abounding in eloquent expressions.<a id="FNanchor_VIIp-8" href="#Footnote_VIIp-8" class="fnanchor">[VII'-8]</a> Of the Eudeve
dialect I insert a few grammatical remarks. In the
alphabet are wanting the letters <i>f</i>, <i>j</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>w</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>l</i>;
vowels are pronounced as in the Spanish; nouns are
declined without the aid of articles. Verbal nouns are
frequently used;&mdash;<i>hiósguadauh</i>, painting or writing, from
<i>hiósguan</i>, I write. Nouns as names of instruments are
formed from the future active of verbs, designating the
action performed by the said instrument;&mdash;<i>métecan</i>, I
chop; future, <i>métetze</i>, by changing its last syllable into
<i>siven</i>, forms <i>métesiven</i>&mdash;as a noun, meaning axe or chopper.
In some cases the ending <i>rina</i> is used instead of
<i>siven</i>;&mdash;<i>bícusirina</i>, flute, from <i>bicudan</i>, I whistle, and
<i>bihirina</i>, shovel, from <i>bihán</i>, I scrape. Abstract nouns
are formed with the particles <i>ragua</i> or <i>súra</i>&mdash;<i>váde</i>, joyously,
<i>váderagua</i>, joy; <i>déni</i>, good, <i>déniragua</i>, goodness;
<i>dóhme</i>, man or people; <i>dóhmeragua</i>, humanity. All
verbs are used as nouns, and as such are declined as
well as conjugated;&mdash;<i>hiósguan</i>, I write, also means writer;
<i>nemútzau</i>, I bewitch, is also wizard. Adjective nouns
ending with <i>téri</i> and <i>ei</i> signify quality;&mdash;<i>bavitéri</i>, elegant;
<i>aresumetéri</i>, different or distinct; <i>tasúquei</i>, narrow.
The ending <i>ráve</i> denotes plenitude;&mdash;<i>sitoráve</i>, full of
honey; <i>sitóri</i>, honey; and <i>ráve</i>, full. Endings in <i>e</i>, <i>o</i>,
<i>u</i>, signify possession;&mdash;<i>esé</i>, she that has petticoats; <i>nóno</i>,
he that has a father, from <i>nónogua</i>, father; <i>sutúu</i>, he
that has finger-nails, from <i>sutú</i>. <i>Ca</i> prefixed to a word
reverses its meaning;&mdash;<i>cúne</i>, married; <i>cacúne</i>, not married.
<i>Sguari</i>, affixed, denotes an augmentative;&mdash;<i>dotzi</i>,
old man; <i>dotzísguari</i>, very old man.</p>

<p>The plural of nouns is usually formed by duplication;&mdash;<i>dor</i>,
man or male, plural <i>dódor</i>; <i>hóit</i>, woman,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_701">701</a></span>
<i>hóhoit</i>, women. Some exceptions to this rule occur;&mdash;as,
<i>doritzi</i>, boy, plural <i>vus</i>, applied to both sexes, but
when intended only for males, it is <i>dódorus</i>. In some
cases females employ different words from those used by
the male sex; for example, the father says to his son,
<i>noguàt</i>, to his daughter, <i>mórqua</i>; the mother says to
either, <i>nótzgua</i>; the son says to the father, <i>nonógua</i>; and
the daughter, <i>mósgua</i>.</p>

<p>Personal pronouns are <i>nee</i>, I; <i>nap</i>, thou; <i>id</i>, <i>at</i>, or <i>ar</i>,
he, or she; <i>tamide</i>, we; <i>emet</i>, or <i>emíde</i>, you; <i>amét</i>, or
<i>met</i>, these or they. In joining pronouns with other
words, elision takes place, the last letter or syllable of

<p class="sidenote">ÓPATA GRAMMAR.</p>

<p>Of the Ópata, there exists a grammar written by
Natal Lombardo, from which a few remarks are here
given. The alphabet: <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>ch</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>p</i>,
<i>r</i>, <i>rh</i>, <i>s</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>th</i>, <i>tz</i>, <i>u</i>, <i>v</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>z</i>. Most words end with a
vowel. Long words are not rare, as <i>chumikanahuinaguat</i>,
name of a plant; <i>kuguesaguataguikide</i>, spring
(season); <i>makoisenignabussanibegua</i>, seventeen. Gender
is expressed either by the addition of the word, male
or female, or by distinct words. The plural is formed
by duplication; the manner of duplicating varies; sometimes
the first, and at others the last syllable being repeated,
and very frequently letters changed;&mdash;<i>Temachi</i>,
lad; plural, <i>tetemachi</i>; <i>höre</i>, squirrel; plural,
<i>hohore</i>; <i>uri</i>, male; plural, <i>urini</i>; <i>vatziguat</i>, brother;
plural, <i>vapatziguat</i>; <i>maraguat</i>, daughter; plural, <i>mamaraguat</i>,
daughters. Ten declensions are described; they
may be recognized by different endings of the genitive,
which are: <i>te</i>, <i>ri</i>, <i>si</i>, <i>gui</i>, <i>ni</i>, <i>tzi</i>, <i>ki</i>, <i>ku</i>, <i>ku</i>, <i>pi</i>. The
greater number of words belong to the first declension.
In the 2d, 3d, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 10th, the accusative
and dative are the same as the genitive; in the 8th
the genitive, which ends in <i>ku</i>, is formed from the accusative,
while in the 9th, in which the genitive also ends
in <i>ku</i>, the accusative and dative are like the nominative.</p>

whiteness. To express a local noun, the
syllable <i>de</i> is added;&mdash;<i>denide</i>, place of light; <i>neomachide</i>,
difficult place. <i>Suraua</i>, <i>guëua</i>, <i>ena</i>, <i>en</i>, <i>essa</i>, and <i>otze</i>,

<p>As in the Eudeve, there are in this language many
classes of verbs, differing mostly in endings of certain
persons. Prepositions and adverbs exist in great number.
Finally I give a few of the conjunctions;&mdash;<i>guetza</i>,
although; <i>vesé</i>, and; <i>nemake</i>, also; <i>naneguari</i>, why, etc.

<p class="sidenote">SUPPOSED CERI AND WELSH SIMILARITIES.</p>

<p>East of the Ópata and Pima bajo, on the shores of
the gulf of California, and thence for some distance inland,
and also on the island of Tiburon, the Ceri language
with its dialects, the Guaymi and Tepoca, is spoken.
Few of the words are known, and the excuse given
by travelers for not taking vocabularies, is, that it was
too difficult to catch the sound. It is represented as
extremely harsh and guttural in its pronunciation, and
well suited to the people who speak it, who are described
as wild and fierce.<a id="FNanchor_VIIp-11" href="#Footnote_VIIp-11" class="fnanchor">[VII'-11]</a> It is, so far as known,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_705">705</a></span>
not related to any of the Mexican linguistic families.
As in many other languages, some have fancied they
saw Welsh traces in it; one writer thought he detected
similarities to Arabic, but neither of these speculations
are worth anything. The Arabic relationship has been
disproven by Señor Ramirez, who compared the two,
and the statement regarding the Welsh is given on
the hearsay of some sailors, who are said to have stated
that they thought they discovered some Welsh sounds,
when hearing the Ceris speak.<a id="FNanchor_VIIp-12" href="#Footnote_VIIp-12" class="fnanchor">[VII'-12]</a> I give here the only
vocabulary which I have been able to find of this
language:</p>

</p>

<p>We now come to the four Aztec-Sonora languages
before mentioned, the Cora, the Cahita, the Tepehuana,
and the Tarahumara, and their neighbors. I have already
said that notwithstanding the Aztec element
contained in them, they are in no wise related to each
other.</p>

<p class="sidenote">NUMEROUS LANGUAGES IN SINALOA.</p>

<p>In the northern part of Sinaloa, extending across the
boundary into Sonora, the principal language is the
Cahita, spoken in many dialects, of most of which
nothing is transmitted to us. Numerous languages,
which were perhaps only dialects, are named in this
region, and by some classed with the Cahita, but the
information regarding them is vague and contradictory.
No vocabularies or other specimens of them can be
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_707">707</a></span>
obtained, nor can I find anywhere mention that any
were ever written. Of these there are the Zoe, the
Guazave, the Vacoregue, the Batucari, the Aibino, the
Ocoroni, which are mentioned as related, as also the
Zuaque and Tehueco, and the Comoporis and Ahome.
There are also the Mocorito and Petatlan, both distinct;
the Huite, the Ore, the Varogio, the Tauro, the
Macoyahui, the Troe, the Nio, the Cahuimeto, the
Tepague, the Ohuero, the Chicorata, the Basopa, and
two distinct tongues spoken at the Mission San Andres
de Conicari, and four at the Mission of San Miguel do
Mocorito.<a id="FNanchor_VIIIp-1" href="#Footnote_VIIIp-1" class="fnanchor">[VIII'-1]</a> The only dialects of the Cahita, regarding
which a few notes exist, and which at the same time
appear to have been the principal ones, according to
the best authorities, are the Mayo, Yaqui, and Tehueco.<a id="FNanchor_VIIIp-2" href="#Footnote_VIIIp-2" class="fnanchor">[VIII'-2]</a>
The Cahita language is copious, but will not readily
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_708">708</a></span>
express polite sentiments.<a id="FNanchor_VIIIp-3" href="#Footnote_VIIIp-3" class="fnanchor">[VIII'-3]</a> Father Ribas says that the
Yaquis always speak very loudly and arrogantly, and
that when he asked them to lower their voice, they answered:
"Dost thou not see that I am a Yaqui?"
which latter word signifies, 'he who speaks loudly.'<a id="FNanchor_VIIIp-4" href="#Footnote_VIIIp-4" class="fnanchor">[VIII'-4]</a></p>

<p>A grammar of the Cahita was written in the year
1737, of which I give here an extract. The alphabet
consists of the following letters: <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>ch</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>j</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>l</i>,
<i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>s</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>u</i>, <i>v</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>tz</i>.</p>

<p>There are three declensions; two for nouns, and the
third for adjectives. To the first belong those words
which end in a vowel, and also the participles ending
with <i>me</i> and <i>u</i>; to the second, those ending with a consonant.
Nouns ending with a vowel, and adjectives, form
the plural by appending an <i>m</i> to the singular;&mdash;<i>tabu</i>, rabbit;
<i>tabum</i>, rabbits. Those ending with a consonant
affix <i>im</i>, and those ending with <i>t</i> affix <i>zim</i>;&mdash;<i>paros</i>, hare;
<i>parosim</i>, hares; <i>uikit</i>, bird; <i>uikitzim</i>, birds. The personal
pronouns are: <i>inopo</i>, <i>neheriua</i>, <i>neheri</i>, <i>nehe</i>, <i>ne</i>, I;
<i>itopo</i>, <i>iteriua</i>, <i>itee</i>, <i>te</i>, we; <i>empo</i>, <i>eheriua</i>, <i>eheri</i>, <i>ehee</i>, <i>e</i>,
thou; <i>empom</i>, <i>emeriua</i>, <i>emeri</i>, <i>emee</i>, <i>em</i>, you; <i>uahaa</i>,
<i>uahariua</i>, <i>uahari</i>, he; <i>uameriua</i>, <i>uameri</i>, <i>uamee</i>, <i>im</i>, they.</p>

<p>The dialectic differences between the Mayo, Yaqui,
and Tehueco are as follows;&mdash;the Yaquis and Mayos
use the letter <i>h</i>, where the Tehuecos use <i>s</i> when it
occurs in the middle of a word, and is followed by a
consonant;&mdash;<i>tuhta</i>, by the Tehuecos is pronounced
<i>tusta</i>. Other words also, by some are pronounced
short, while others pronounce them long. The interjection
of the vocative is with some <i>hiua</i>, and with
others <i>me</i>. The pronoun <i>nepo</i>, the Yaquis use instead
of <i>inopo</i>. The Mayos use the imperfect as before given;
the Tehuecos end it with <i>t</i>, and the Yaquis with <i>n</i>.
The pluperfect of the Tehuecos ends with <i>k</i>; that of
the Yaquis with <i>kam</i>; that of the Maya with <i>kai</i>.</p>

<p>To illustrate dialectic differences, I insert a short
comparative vocabulary, made up from a dictionary, a
doctrina, and from words of the Mayo and two Yaqui
dialects:</p>

<p class="sidenote">GRAMMAR OF THE TARAHUMARA LANGUAGE.</p>

<p>East of the Cahita, in the states of Chihuahua,
Sonora, and Durango, an uncivilized and barbarous
people inhabit the Sierra Madre, who speak the Tarahumara
tongue, which contains the same Aztec element
as the Cahita, but is otherwise, as previously stated, a
distinct language. The principal dialects are the Varogio,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_711">711</a></span>
Guazapare and Pachera.<a id="FNanchor_VIIIp-6" href="#Footnote_VIIIp-6" class="fnanchor">[VIII'-6]</a> The Tarahumara is a rather
difficult language to acquire, mainly owing to its pronunciation.
The final syllables of words are frequently
omitted or swallowed, and sometimes even the first
syllables or letters. The accentuation also differs much,
nouns generally being accentuated on the penultimate,
and verbs on the ultimate. The alphabet consists of
the following letters: <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>ch</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>j</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>l</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>r</i>,
<i>s</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>u</i>, <i>v</i>, <i>y</i>. These letters, and also the following grammatical
remarks refer specially to the language as
spoken in Chinipas. Other dialects have the letter <i>h</i>
in place of <i>j</i> or <i>r</i>, and <i>z</i> for <i>s</i>. The plural of nouns is
formed by duplicating a syllable;&mdash;<i>mukí</i>, woman; <i>mumukí</i>,
women; or, in some cases an adverb, indicating
the plural, is appended. Patronymics form the plural,
by duplicating the last syllable. The particle <i>gua</i> also
indicates the plural. The possessive case is formed by
annexing the syllable <i>ra</i> to the thing possessed;&mdash;<i>Pedro
bukúra</i>, house of Pedro. Comparatives are expressed
by adding the terminal <i>be</i>;&mdash;<i>gara</i>, good; <i>garabé</i>, better;
and superlatives by simply putting a heavier accent on
the comparative terminal;&mdash;<i>reré</i>, low; <i>rerebé</i>, lower;
<i>rerebéé</i>, lowest. Personal pronouns are: <i>nejé</i>, I; <i>mujé</i>,
thou; <i>senú</i>, he; <i>tamujé</i> or <i>ramujé</i>, we; <i>emejé</i> or <i>emé</i>,
you; <i>güepuná</i>, they.</p>

<p>Of the different dialects there are five specimens, all
Lord's Prayers, a comparison of which will show their
variations.  The first is from Father Steffel:</p>

<p>
Tamí Nonó, mamú reguí guamí gatíkí, tamí noinéruje

<p>The second is from Tellechea, who lived in Chinipas
and at Zapópan:</p>

<p>
Tamú nonó repá regiiegáchi atígameque muteguárarí

<p>The third is in the dialect spoken in the district of
Mina:</p>

<p>

<p>Although in possession of Tellechea's grammar, Gallatin
denies the connection between the Tarahumara
and the Aztec.<a id="FNanchor_VIIIp-9" href="#Footnote_VIIIp-9" class="fnanchor">[VIII'-9]</a> I give here some of their grammatical
resemblances. These are, the incorporation
of the noun with the verb in some cases; the
combination of two verbs, the dropping of the original
end-syllables when joining or incorporating several
words together, the formation of the plural by duplication,
and the traces of a reverential end syllable.
All these are important points, and combined with the
similarity&mdash;in some cases even identity&mdash;of a great
number of words, they make the relationship or traces
of the Aztec language in the Tarahumara incontestable.<a id="FNanchor_VIIIp-10" href="#Footnote_VIIIp-10" class="fnanchor">[VIII'-10]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Passing to the north-eastern part of Mexico I enter a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_714">714</a></span>
totally unknown region, of whose languages mention is
made, but nothing more. Neither vocabularies, nor
grammars, nor any other specimens of them exist, and
in most cases it is even difficult to fix the exact geographical
location of the people who are reported to
have spoken them. Of these I name first the Concho,
which language is reported to have been a dialect of
the Aztec, but this is denied by Hervás, who had his
information from the missionary Palacios, although the
latter admits that the people spoke the Aztec. Their
location is stated to have been near the Rio Concho.<a id="FNanchor_VIIIp-11" href="#Footnote_VIIIp-11" class="fnanchor">[VIII'-11]</a>
In the Bolson de Mapimi, the Toboso language is
named. This people are reported to have understood
the language of the Zacatecs and the Aztecs; and
furthermore, to have had their own distinct tongue.<a id="FNanchor_VIIIp-12" href="#Footnote_VIIIp-12" class="fnanchor">[VIII'-12]</a>
Other idioms mentioned near the same region are the
Hualahuise, Julime, Piro, Suma, and Chinarra.<a id="FNanchor_VIIIp-13" href="#Footnote_VIIIp-13" class="fnanchor">[VIII'-13]</a> Of
the Piro I find the following Lord's Prayer:</p>

<p>
Quitatác nasaul e yapolhua tol húy quiamgiana mi
quiamnarinú. Jaquie mugilley nasamagui hikiey quiamsamaé,
mukiataxám, hikiey, hiquiquiamo quia inaé,

pemcihipompo y, qui solakuey quifollohipuca. Kuey
maihua atellan, folliquitey. Amen.</p>

<p>The Irritila, which was spoken by a number of
tribes, called by the Spaniards the Laguneros, inhabiting
the country near the Missions of Parras, is another
extinct tongue.<a id="FNanchor_VIIIp-14" href="#Footnote_VIIIp-14" class="fnanchor">[VIII'-14]</a> In Coahuila, the Tejano or
Coahuiltec language is found. A short manual for the
use of the priests was written in this language by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_715">715</a></span>
Father García, and from it a few grammatical observations
have been drawn by Pimentel.</p>

<p class="sidenote">EXTRACT FROM THE COAHUILTEC GRAMMAR.</p>

<p>The letters used are <i>a</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>ch</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>j</i>, <i>l</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>q</i>,
<i>s</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>u</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>tz</i>. The pronunciation is similar to that of
some of the people who inhabit the Northwest Coast, as
the Nootkas, Thlinkeets, and others. A kind of clicking
sound produced with the tongue, which García designates
by an apostrophe, thus&mdash;<i>c'</i>, <i>q'</i>, <i>t'</i>, <i>p'</i>, <i>l'</i>. The <i>c'</i>,
and <i>q'</i>, are pronounced with a rasping sound from the
root of the tongue; <i>t'</i> with a click with the point of the
tongue against the teeth, etc. There is no plural in the
language except such as is expressed by the words many,
all, and some. Pronouns are <i>tzin</i>, I; <i>jamin</i>, or <i>am</i>, thou;
<i>nami</i>, mine; <i>ja</i>, thine; <i>jami</i>, ours. Interrogation is expressed
by the letter <i>e</i> after the verb;&mdash;<i>japtû pôé?</i> are
you a father? <i>po</i> being the verb. Negation is expressed
by <i>ojua</i>, if it stands for 'no' alone, but if it is joined to a
verb it is expressed by <i>ajâm</i> following the verb, and if
the verb ends with a vowel, by <i>yajâm</i>. The Tejano is
divided into several dialects which vary chiefly in the
different pronunciation of some words: as for <i>che</i> they
say <i>chi</i>, or <i>so</i> for <i>se</i>, <i>cue</i> instead of <i>co</i>, etc. The following
soul-winning dogma with the translation is given as
a specimen of the language.</p>

<p>Mej t' oajâm pitucuêj pînta pilapâm chojâi pilchê

<p>And there in hell there is nothing to eat, nor any

great fire of hell will never be finished. If thou hadst
died with those sins, thou wouldst be already there in
hell; then, why art thou not afraid?<a id="FNanchor_VIIIp-15" href="#Footnote_VIIIp-15" class="fnanchor">[VIII'-15]</a></p>

<p>The Tubar is another idiom which was spoken near
the head-waters of the Rio Sinaloa. Ribas affirms that
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_716">716</a></span>
two totally distinct languages are spoken by this people.
From a Lord's Prayer preserved in this tongue Mr
Buschmann after careful comparison has concluded that
the Tubar is another member of the Aztec-Sonora group,
showing, as it does, unmistakeable Aztec traces. I insert
the Lord's Prayer with translation.</p>

<p>The following is a Lord's Prayer of the Tubar dialect
spoken in the district of Mina in Chihuahua.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_717">717</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">TEPEHUANA GRAMMAR.</p>

<p>In the state of Durango and extending into parts of
Jalisco, Chihuahua, Coahuila and Sonora, is spoken the
Tepehuana language.<a id="FNanchor_VIIIp-18" href="#Footnote_VIIIp-18" class="fnanchor">[VIII'-18]</a> Like the Tarahumara it is guttural
and pronounced in a rather sputtering manner.
The Tepehuanes speak very fast, and often leave off or
swallow the end syllables, which occasioned much trouble
to the missionaries, who on that account could not easily
understand them. Another difficulty is the accentuation,
as the slightest variation of accent will change the
meaning of a word.<a id="FNanchor_VIIIp-19" href="#Footnote_VIIIp-19" class="fnanchor">[VIII'-19]</a> The following alphabet is used to
represent the sound of the Tephuana, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>ch</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>,
<i>i</i>, <i>j</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>l</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>q</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>s</i>, <i>sc</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>u</i>, <i>v</i>, <i>y</i>. In the formation
of words many vowels are frequently combined, as,
<i>ooo</i>, bone; <i>iiuie</i>, to drink. Long words are of frequent
occurrence as&mdash;<i>soigulidadatudadamo</i>, difficult; <i>meit sciuguidodadaguitodadamoe</i>,
continually. The letter <i>d</i> appears
to be very frequently used, as in the word&mdash;<i>toddascidaraga</i>,
or <i>doadidamodaraga</i>, fright. To form the plural
of words, the first syllable is duplicated. Personal pronouns
are;&mdash;<i>aneane</i>, or <i>ane</i>, I; <i>api</i>, thou; <i>eggue</i>, he; <i>atum</i>,
we; <i>apum</i>, you; <i>eggama</i>, they; <i>in</i>, mine; <i>u</i>, thine; <i>di</i>,
or <i>de</i>, his; <i>ut</i>, ours; <i>um</i>, yours.</p>

<p>The roughest and most inaccessible part of the Sierra
Madre, in the state of Durango, is the seat of the
Acaxee language, which from this centre spreads, under
different names and dialects, into the neighboring
states. Among these dialects are mentioned the
Topia, Sabaibo, Xixime, Hume, Mediotaquel and Tebaca.<a id="FNanchor_VIIIp-21" href="#Footnote_VIIIp-21" class="fnanchor">[VIII'-21]</a>
Some writers claim that the Acaxee with all its
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_719">719</a></span>
differences is related to the Mexican, while others, among
them Balbi, make it a distinct tongue. As neither vocabularies
nor other specimens of it exist, the real fact
cannot be ascertained. The missionaries say that the
Aztec language was spoken and understood in these parts.
In Zacatecas is mentioned as the prevailing tongue the
Zacatec, besides which some authors speak of the Cazcane
as a distinct idiom, while others aver that the Cazcanes
and Zacatecs were one people. Besides these there
are adjoining them the Mazapile, Huitcole, and Guachichile,
of none of which do I find any specimens or vocabularies.<a id="FNanchor_VIIIp-22" href="#Footnote_VIIIp-22" class="fnanchor">[VIII'-22]</a>
I also find mentioned in Zacatecas the Colotlan,
and in Jalisco the Tlaxomulteca, Tecuexe, and Tepecano.<a id="FNanchor_VIIIp-23" href="#Footnote_VIIIp-23" class="fnanchor">[VIII'-23]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">THE CORA LANGUAGE AND ITS DIALECTS.</p>

<p class="p2">In that portion of the state of Jalisco which is known
by the name of Nayarit, the Cora language is spoken.
It is divided into three dialects; the Muutzicat, spoken in
the heart of the mountains; the Teacuaeitzica, on the
mountain slopes; and the Cora, or Ateacari, near the
mouth of the Rio Nayarit, or Jesus María.<a id="FNanchor_VIIIp-24" href="#Footnote_VIIIp-24" class="fnanchor">[VIII'-24]</a> The Aztec
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_720">720</a></span>
element, which is stronger and more apparent in the
Cora than in any other of the three Aztec-Sonora languages,
has been recognized by many of the earliest
writers.<a id="FNanchor_VIIIp-25" href="#Footnote_VIIIp-25" class="fnanchor">[VIII'-25]</a> The Cora language is intricate and rather
difficult to learn, as indeed are the other three.<a id="FNanchor_VIIIp-26" href="#Footnote_VIIIp-26" class="fnanchor">[VIII'-26]</a> Following
are a few grammatical notes taken from Ortega's
vocabulary.</p>

<p>The letters of the alphabet are <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>ch</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>,
<i>o</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>u</i>, <i>v</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>tz</i>. The pronunciation is hard;
there is no established way of expressing the gender.
The names of animated beings, as well as inanimate
objects form the plural by the affixes <i>te</i>, <i>eri</i> or <i>ri</i>, <i>tzi</i> or
<i>zi</i>, and also with the preposition <i>mea</i>, although there
are some exceptions to this rule; for example;&mdash;<i>zearate</i>,
bee; <i>zearateri</i>, bees; <i>kanax</i>, sheep; <i>kanexeri</i>, sheep;
<i>ukubihuame</i>, orator; <i>ukubihuametzi</i>, orators; <i>teatzahuateakame</i>,
he who is obedient, of which the plural is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_721">721</a></span>
<i>teatzahuateakametzi</i>; <i>kurute</i>, crane; <i>kurutzi</i>, cranes; <i>teaxka</i>,
scorpion; <i>teaxkate</i>, scorpions. Verbal nouns designating
a person who performs an action, are formed by
affixing to the verb the syllable <i>kame</i>, or <i>huame</i>;&mdash;<i>hukabihuame</i>,
advocate (he who pleads); <i>timuacheakame</i>, lover,
(he who loves); <i>tichuikame</i>, singer, (he who sings).</p>

<p class="sidenote">CORA GRAMMAR AND LORD'S PRAYER.</p>

<p>Personal pronouns are;&mdash;<i>neapue</i>, <i>nea</i>, I; <i>apue</i>, <i>ap</i>,
thou; <i>aehpu</i>, <i>aehp</i>, he; <i>iteammo</i>, <i>itean</i>, we; <i>ammo</i>, <i>an</i>,
you; <i>aehmo</i>, <i>aehm</i>, they; but in conjugating the following
are used:&mdash;<i>ne</i>, I; <i>pe</i> or <i>pa</i>, thou; <i>te</i>, we; <i>ze</i>, you; <i>me</i>,
they. Of the conjugation of the verb, it is only stated
that there is no infinitive, and the following example of
the present indicative is given:</p>

<table summary="Cora Present Indicative" class="tenses">
<tr>
<td>I love,</td>
<td class="br">nemuache</td>
<td>We love,</td>
<td>te muache</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Thou lovest,</td>
<td class="br">pemuache</td>
<td>You love,</td>
<td>ze muache</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>He loves,</td>
<td class="br">muache</td>
<td>They love,</td>
<td>me muache</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>There are plural and singular verbs;&mdash;<i>tachuite</i>, to give
a long thing; <i>taihte</i>, to give long things.</p>

<p>Prepositions are:&mdash;<i>hetze</i>, <i>tzahta</i>, in; <i>keme</i>, with, for;
<i>apoan</i>, above; <i>tihauze</i>, before. The peculiarity of the
Muutzicat dialect is the frequent use of the letter <i>r</i>,
which is either appended, or placed in the middle of
the word at pleasure;&mdash;for <i>huihma</i>, they say <i>ruihma</i>;
for <i>earit</i>, <i>erarit</i>. The Teakuaeitzicai dialect has many
distinct words not used in any of the others, so that
at times they are not at all understood by those speaking
the other dialects. As a specimen I insert the
Lord's Prayer:</p>

<span class="s08">THE AZTEC AND OTOMÍ LANGUAGES.</span></h2>

<p class="ch_summ">
<span class="smcap">Nahua or Aztec, Chichimec, and Toltec languages identical&mdash;Anáhuac
the aboriginal seat of the Aztec Tongue&mdash;The Aztec the oldest
language in Anáhuac&mdash;Beauty and Richness of the Aztec&mdash;Testimony
of the Missionaries and early writers in its favor&mdash;Specimen

Grammar&mdash;Otomí Lord's Prayer in different Dialects.</span>
</p>

<p>The Nahua, Aztec, or Mexican, is the language of
Mexican civilization, spoken throughout the greater
part of Montezuma's empire, extending from the plateau
of Anáhuac, or valley of Mexico, as a centre, eastward
to the gulf of Mexico, and along its shores from above
Vera Cruz east to the Rio Goatzacoalcos; westward to
the Pacific, and upon its border from about the twenty-sixth
to the sixteenth parallel, thus forming an irregular
but continuous linguistic line from the gulf of
California south-east, across the Mexican plateau to the
gulf of Mexico, of more than four hundred leagues
in extent. Again, it is found on the coast of Salvador,
and in the interior of Nicaragua, and we have
before seen its connection with the nations of the north.
Within the limits of the ancient Mexican empire many
other languages besides the Aztec were spoken, as for
instance the Otomí, Huastec, Totonac, Zapotec, Miztec,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_724">724</a></span>
and Tarasco, about twenty in all. It has been claimed
by some that the languages of the Toltecs and Chichimecs
were different from each other, and from
the Aztec; it has even been intimated that traces of a
language more ancient than any of these have been
found. Pedro de los Rios mentions two words of a
song used in the religious ceremonies at Cholula, <i>tulanian
hululaez</i>&mdash;which he says belong to a language
not understood by the Mexicans, and Alexander von
Humboldt thinks they may be the remains of some
pre-Mexican language.<a id="FNanchor_IXp-1" href="#Footnote_IXp-1" class="fnanchor">[IX'-1]</a> Others, and among them the
Abbé Brasseur de Bourbourg, claim greater antiquity
for the Maya, affirming that it was spoken in Mexico
before the Nahua-speaking people reached that country.</p>

<p>From a careful examination of the early authorities,
I can but entertain the opinion that the Toltec, Chichimec,
and Aztec languages are one, that the Nahua, or
Aztec, is the oldest known language of Anáhuac, and
that contrary conclusions arrived at by certain later
writers are merely speculative. All of the many different
peoples mentioned as aboriginal in ancient Anáhuac
are said to have spoken the Aztec, as the Ulmecs,
Xicalancas, Tecpanecs, Colhuas, Acolhuas, Nahuas, etc.
Ixtlilxochitl, the native Tezcucan historian, relates that
by order of the ruler, Techotlalatzin, the Chichimecs
dropped their own tongue and adopted that of the Aztecs.<a id="FNanchor_IXp-2" href="#Footnote_IXp-2" class="fnanchor">[IX'-2]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_725">725</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">ORIGINALITY OF THE AZTEC TONGUE.</p>

<p>Furthermore, internal evidence is all in favor of the
originality of the Aztec tongue. Throughout the great
empire of Anáhuac it was the dominant stock language.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_726">726</a></span>
Towards the north, as we have seen, sprinklings of it
are found in many places, but nowhere does it appear
in that direction as a base. Far to the south, in Nicaragua,
it is again found as the stock tongue, yet with a
dialectic rather than an aboriginal appearance, so that
the testimony of language is all in favor of the plateau
of Anáhuac having been the primal centre of the Aztec
tongue, rather than its having been introduced within
any measurable epoch by immigration.</p>

<p>That the Mexican nation did its utmost to extend
the language is certain. It was the court language of
American civilization, the Latin of medieval and the
French of modern times; it was used as the means of
holding intercourse with non-Aztec speaking people,
also by all ambassadors, and in all official communications;
in all newly acquired and conquered territories it
was immediately introduced as the official language, and
the people were ordered to learn it. It, or its kindred
dialects, can be said to have been the common vernacular
in the whole interior of Anáhuac, and over a large
part of the Aztec plateau, although within these limits
other tongues were in vogue. Southward, it again appears
along the shores of the Pacific Ocean. It was
spoken as far as Guatemala, in the interior of which it
appeared in the shape of various dialects more or less
corrupted. It can also be traced into Tabasco, and even
into Yucatan on the Atlantic coast. It is again encountered
in the gulf of Amatique, whence lines extend
connecting with the branches of the Aztec in Guatemala,
Honduras, and Nicaragua. It is also possible that
it may at one time have been used even east of the Mississippi,
as will appear from the following statements of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_727">727</a></span>
Acosta and Sahagun. The latter says that the Apalaches
living east of the Mississippi extended their expeditions
and colonies far into Mexico, and were proud
to show to the first conquerors of their country the great
highways on which they traveled. Acosta affirms that
the Mexicans called these Apalaches, Tlatuices or mountaineers.
Sahagun, speaking of them, says "they are Nahoas,
and speak the Mexican language."<a id="FNanchor_IXp-3" href="#Footnote_IXp-3" class="fnanchor">[IX'-3]</a> This is by no
means improbable, as the Aztec is found eastward in the
present states of Tamaulipas and Coahuila, and thence
the distance to the Mississippi is not so very far.<a id="FNanchor_IXp-4" href="#Footnote_IXp-4" class="fnanchor">[IX'-4]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE AZTEC LANGUAGE EAST OF MEXICO.</p>

<p>Of all the languages spoken on the American continent,
the Aztec is the most perfect and finished, approaching
in this respect the tongues of Europe and
Asia, and actually surpassing many of them by its
elegance of expression. Although wanting the six
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_728">728</a></span>
consonants, <i>b</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>s</i>, it may still be called full and
rich. Of its copiousness the Natural History of Dr
Hernandez gives evidence, in which are described
twelve hundred different species of Mexican plants,
two hundred or more species of birds, and a large
number of quadrupeds, reptiles, insects, and metals,
each of which is given its proper name in the Mexican
language.<a id="FNanchor_IXp-5" href="#Footnote_IXp-5" class="fnanchor">[IX'-5]</a> Mendieta says that it is not excelled
in beauty by the Latin, displaying even more art in
its construction, and abounding in tropes and metaphors.
Camargo calls it the richest of the whole land, and the
purest, being mixed with no foreign barbaric element;
Gomara says it is the best, most copious, and most
extended in all New Spain; Dávila Padilla, that it is
very elegant and graceful, although it contains many
metaphors which make it difficult; Lorenzana, that it
is very elegant, sweet, and complete; Clavigero, that it is
copious, polite, and expressive; Brasseur de Bourbourg,
that from the most sublime heights it descends to common
things with a sonorousness and richness of expression
peculiar only to itself. The missionaries found
it ample for their purpose, as in it and without the aid
of foreign words they could express all the shades of
their dogmas, from the thunderings and anathemas of
Sinai to the sublime teachings of the Christ.</p>

<p>Although the Spaniards usually employed the word
Dios for God, the Aztecs offered one as fit, their Teotl,
and Tloque Nahuaque, signifying invisible supreme
being. The many written Aztec sermons, catechisms,
and rituals also attest the copiousness of the tongue.<a id="FNanchor_IXp-6" href="#Footnote_IXp-6" class="fnanchor">[IX'-6]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_729">729</a></span>
The Mexican, like the Hebrew and French, does
not possess superlative nouns, and like the Hebrew
and most of the living European languages, it has no
comparatives, their place being supplied by certain
particles. The Aztec contains more diminutives and
augmentatives than the Italian, and is probably richer
than any other tongue in the world in verbal nouns
and abstracts, there being hardly a verb from which
verbal nouns cannot be formed, or a substantive or
adjective of which abstracts are not made. It is equally
rich in verbs, for every verb is the root from which
others of different meanings spring. Agglutination or
aggregation is carried to its widest extent, and words of
inordinate length are not uncommon. In agglutinating,
end-syllables or letters are usually dropped, principally
for the sake of euphony. A prayer to the Virgin of
Guadalupe, which is to be found in the <i>Promptuario
Manual</i> of Paredes, I insert here as a curious specimen
of long words:</p>

<p class="sidenote p2">SPECIMEN OF LONG AZTEC WORDS.</p>

Though the Aztecs made verses, no specimens of their
poetry have been preserved except in a translated
form. One, composed by the great Tezcucan, King
Nezahualcoyotl, translated in full in the preceding
volume, gives us an exalted idea of the advanced state
of the language.<a id="FNanchor_IXp-9" href="#Footnote_IXp-9" class="fnanchor">[IX'-9]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_731">731</a></span></p>

<p>The Mexican language employs the following letters: <i>a</i>,
<i>ç</i>, <i>ch</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>l</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>q</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>tl</i>, <i>tz</i>, <i>u</i>, <i>v</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>. The pronunciation
is soft and musical, and free from nasal
sound. The <i>a</i> is clear; <i>ch</i> before a vowel is pronounced
as in Spanish; but before a consonant, or when
a terminal, it differs somewhat; <i>e</i> is clear; <i>h</i> is an aspirate,
in general soft, being strong only when it precedes
<i>u</i>. No word commences with the letter <i>l</i>; <i>ll</i> is pronounced
as in English. The <i>t</i> is sometimes silent, but
not when it comes between two <i>l's</i>; <i>tl</i> in the middle of
a word is soft, as in Spanish, but as a terminal it is
pronounced <i>tle</i>, the <i>e</i> half mute; <i>tz</i> is similar to the
Spanish <i>s</i>, but a little stronger; the <i>v</i> is by the women
pronounced as in Spanish, but men give it a sound
very similar to <i>hu</i> in Spanish; <i>x</i> is soft, like <i>sh</i> in
English; <i>z</i> is like <i>s</i> in Spanish, but less hissing.</p>

<p class="sidenote">AGGLUTINATION IN THE AZTEC LANGUAGE.</p>

<p>By compounding, the Mexicans make many long
words, some even of sixteen syllables; but there are also
some non-compounded words that are very long. Words
are compounded by uniting a number of whole words,
and not alone by simple juxtaposition, since, with much
attention to brevity and euphony, letters and syllables
are frequently omitted. For instance;&mdash;<i>tlazotli</i>,
loved; <i>mahuiztik</i>; honorable, or reverend; <i>teopixqui</i>,
priest; <i>tatli</i>, father; <i>no</i>, mine; of which is composed <i>notlazomahuizteopixcatzin</i>,
that is to say, my very esteemed
father and reverend priest. This also presents an example
of the ending <i>tzin</i>, which simply signifies respect.
<i>Teopixqui</i> is composed of <i>teotl</i>, God, and <i>pia</i>, to guard.
There are two particles which may be appropriately
called ligatures, as they serve to unite words in certain
cases; they are <i>ca</i> and <i>ti</i>. <i>Kualani</i>, to irritate, to anger;
<i>itta</i>, consider, reflect; <i>nikualanicaitta</i>, to observe with
anger, angrily.</p>

<p>By reason of these compounded words, the meaning
of a whole sentence is often contained in a single word,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_732">732</a></span>
as;&mdash;<i>tlalnepantla</i>, in the middle of the earth, or, situated
in the middle; <i>popocatepetl</i>, smoking mountain; <i>atzcaputzalli</i>,
ant-hill, or, place where there are many people
moving&mdash;alluding to a dense population; <i>cuauhnahuac</i>,
(Cuernavaca) near to the trees; <i>atlixco</i>, above the water;
<i>tepetitlan</i>, above the mountain, etc.</p>

<p>There are several ways of expressing the plural.
As a rule, plurals are applied only to animate objects.
Inanimate objects seldom change in the plural,
as;&mdash;<i>ce tetl</i>, one stone; <i>yei tetl</i>, three stones; <i>miec tetl</i>,
many stones. In exceptional cases the plural of inanimate
objects is expressed by terminals. One of
these exceptions is when the object is connected with
persons, as;&mdash;<i>zoquitl</i>, mud; <i>tizoquime</i>, we are earth; but
there are again exceptions to this rule, as for instance;&mdash;<i>ilhuicame</i>,
the heavens; <i>tepeme</i>, mountains; <i>zitlaltin</i>, stars.
Sometimes inanimate things also form the plural by
doubling the first syllable;&mdash;<i>tetla</i>, place full of stones;
<i>tetetla</i>, places full of stones; <i>calli</i>, house; cacalli, houses.
These various terminations may be reduced to the following
rules. Primitive words have the plural in <i>me</i>,
<i>tin</i>, or <i>que</i>, as;&mdash;<i>ichcatl</i>, a sheep; <i>ichcame</i>, sheep; <i>zolin</i>, a
quail, <i>zoltin</i>, quail; <i>cocoxqui</i>, sick; <i>cocoxque</i>, sick (plural);
<i>topile</i>, constable; <i>topileque</i>, constables. Derivatives form
the plural as follows: those called reverentials, ending
with <i>tzintli</i>, have in the plural <i>tzitzintin</i>. Diminutives,
ending in <i>tontli</i>, have in the plural <i>totontin</i>, and diminutives
ending in <i>ton</i> and <i>pil</i>, augmentatives in <i>pol</i>, and
reverentials in <i>tzin</i>, double the terminal, as;&mdash;<i>tlacatzintli</i>,
person; <i>tlacatzitzintin</i>, persons; <i>ichcatontli</i>, a lamb; <i>ichcatatontin</i>,
lambs; <i>ichcapil</i>, lamb; <i>ichcapipil</i>, lambs; <i>chichiton</i>,
a little dog; <i>chichitoton</i>, little dogs; <i>huehuetzin</i>,
old man; <i>huehuetzitzin</i>, old men.</p>

<p>Words into whose composition the possessive pronoun
enters, whether primitive or derivative, have for the
plural <i>van</i> or <i>huan</i>;&mdash;<i>noichcahuan</i>, my sheep; <i>noichcatotonhuan</i>,
my little sheep. The words <i>tlcatl</i>, man, <i>ciuatl</i>,
woman, and those which imply an official or professional
position, form the plural simply by leaving off
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_733">733</a></span>
the last letters, as;&mdash;<i>mexicatl</i>, plural, <i>mexicá</i>; in which
case, however, the ultimate syllable is accented. Some
words, to form the plural, double the first syllable, and
also use terminals, as;&mdash;<i>teotl</i>, God; <i>teteo</i>, gods; <i>zolin</i>,
quail; <i>zozoltin</i>, quails; <i>zitli</i>, hare; <i>ziziltin</i>, hares. <i>Telpochtli</i>
and <i>ichpochtli</i>, double the syllable <i>po</i>.</p>

<p>Some adjectives have several plurals, as;&mdash;<i>miec</i>,
much; plural, <i>miectin</i>, <i>miecintin</i>, or <i>miecin</i>. Gender is
expressed by adding the words <i>oquichtli</i> or <i>ciuatl</i>, male
and female, except in such words as in themselves indicate
the gender. A father speaking of his son says,
<i>nopiltzin</i>, and a mother of her daughter, <i>noconeuh</i>.</p>

<p class="sidenote">AZTEC GRAMMAR.</p>

<p>There are no regular declensions; in the vocative
case, an <i>e</i> is added to the nominative, or words ending
in <i>tli</i> or <i>li</i>, change the <i>i</i> into <i>e</i>. Those ending in <i>tzin</i> may
change to <i>tze</i> or add an <i>e</i>, but the latter is only used by
males. The genitive is denoted by the possessive pronoun
or by the juxtaposition of the words, as;&mdash;<i>teotl</i>, God;
<i>tenahuatilli</i>, emanating; <i>teotenahuatilli</i>, precept of God.
The dative is indicated by verbs called applicatives; the
accusative, by certain particles which accompany the
verb, or by juxtaposition; as;&mdash;<i>chihua</i>, to have; <i>tlaxcalli</i>,
bread; <i>nitlaxcalchihua</i>, I have bread. The ablative is
indicated by certain particles and prepositions. Diminutives
are formed by the terminals <i>tontli</i> and <i>ton</i>, as;&mdash;<i>chichi</i>,
dog; <i>chichiton</i>, small dog; <i>calli</i>, house; <i>cacontli</i>,
small house. Augmentatives take the syllable <i>pol</i>. The
terminals <i>tla</i>, and <i>la</i>, serve as collectives;&mdash;<i>xochitl</i>, flower;
<i>xochitla</i>, flower-bed. Words ending with <i>otl</i> are abstracts,
as;&mdash;<i>qualli</i>, good; <i>qualotl</i>, goodness. Those ending with
<i>va</i> (<i>hua</i>) and <i>e</i> indicate possession;&mdash;<i>ilhuicatl</i>, heaven;
<i>ilhuicahua</i>, master of heaven, (applied to God). Comparatives
and superlatives have no particular terminations,
but their place is supplied by adverbs, as;&mdash;<i>achi</i>,
<i>ocachi</i>, etc., which mean 'more.' Pedro is better than
Juan, <i>ocachiqualli in Pedro ihuan amo Juan</i>; here the adverb
is connected with <i>quallo</i>, good. Words derived from
active, neuter, passive, reflective and impersonal verbs,
having various significations, terminate in <i>ni</i>, <i>oni</i>, <i>ya</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_734">734</a></span>
<i>ia</i>, <i>yan</i>, <i>can</i>, <i>yau</i>, <i>ian</i>, <i>tli</i>, <i>li</i>, <i>liztli</i>, <i>oca</i>, <i>ca</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>tl</i>; as;&mdash;<i>cochini</i>,
he who sleeps; <i>tlaxcalchihuani</i>, he who has
bread; <i>motlaloani</i>, he who runs; <i>chihualoni</i>, practicable;
<i>neitoniloni</i>, something producing perspiration; <i>notlachiuaya</i>,
my instrument; <i>amotlanequia</i>, our will; <i>tlacualoyan</i>,
eater; <i>micoayan</i>, place to sleep; <i>itepatiayan</i>, hospital;
<i>tlachihualli</i>, created, produced; <i>tetlazotlatiztli</i>, love; <i>nachihualoka</i>,
creation.</p>

<p>Personal pronouns are;&mdash;<i>nehuatl</i>, <i>nehua</i>, <i>ne</i>, I; <i>tehuatl</i>,
<i>tehua</i>, <i>te</i>, thou; <i>yehuatl</i>, <i>yehua</i>, <i>ye</i>, he or somebody; <i>tehuantin</i>,

<p>Many comparisons between the Aztec and the tongues
of Asia and Europe have been made, and relationship
claimed with almost every prominent language, but under
analysis all these fancied affinities vanish. Similarities
in words, in common with all tongues, are found
between the Aztec and others, but at best they can be
called only accidental. Still, a few remarkable word-analogies
have been noticed, among the chief of which
are the following. The Aztec like the Greek and Sanskrit,
uses the privative preposition <i>a</i>, which in the Celtic
has been changed to <i>an</i>, in Latin to <i>in</i>, or <i>im</i>, and in the
German to <i>un</i>;&mdash;Greek, athanatos; Aztec, <i>amiquini</i>, immortal.
Further, in the perfect tense, and sometimes in
the imperfect, <i>o</i> is used in the Aztec, like the Sanskrit <i>a</i>,
and the Greek <i>e</i>. But the most remarkable coincidence is
the word <i>teotl</i>, which is as near as possible to the Greek
<i>Théos</i>. Kingsborough and Mrs Simon see in the Aztec
the language of the Jews; Jones that of the ancient
Tyrians; Lang, that of the Polynesians. García makes
comparisons with the Hebrew, Spanish, Phoenician,
Egyptian, Japanese, and German, and for a relationship
with these and many others he finds claimants. Until
further light is thrown upon American philology, the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_737">737</a></span>
Aztec must stand alone, as one of the independent languages
of the world.<a id="FNanchor_IXp-11" href="#Footnote_IXp-11" class="fnanchor">[IX'-11]</a></p>

<p class="p2">The Otomí, held to be next to the Aztec the most
widely extended language in Mexico, was spoken by a
rough and barbarous people who inhabit the mountains
encircling the valley of Anáhuac, but more particularly
those towards the north-west. Thence it extended into
the present state of San Luis Potosí, was spoken
throughout Querétaro and the larger part of Guanajuato,
and in places in Michoacan, Vera Cruz, and Puebla.<a id="FNanchor_IXp-12" href="#Footnote_IXp-12" class="fnanchor">[IX'-12]</a>
From the Journal and Proceedings of the fourth Provincial
Council, held in Mexico in the year 1771, it appears
that the language was spoken in four dialects, varying
so much that it was only with the greatest difficulty
that the several tribes could hold intercourse.<a id="FNanchor_IXp-13" href="#Footnote_IXp-13" class="fnanchor">[IX'-13]</a> The
only dialect of which particular notice has been taken
is the Mazahua, spoken in the ancient province of Mazahuacan.
Of the others the only specimens are a few
Lord's Prayers.</p>

<p class="sidenote">HYPOTHETICAL OTOMÍ AND CHINESE RELATIONSHIP.</p>

<p>The Otomí claims attention in one particular; it is
the only true monosyllabic language found in the Pacific
States, and this alone has led many to claim relationship
between it and the Chinese.</p>

<p>This Chinese relationship has been mainly advocated
by Señor Nájera, a native Otomí, who in furtherance of
his peculiar views wrote an excellent Otomí grammar, in
an appendix to which he gives an extensive comparison
between the two idioms. But, taking up the words which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_738">738</a></span>
he declares to be similar, we are at once struck with important
omissions on his part. The first is that he has
not at all taken into consideration the difficulty of comparing
monosyllabic languages, in which a word frequently
has ten or more significations, distinguishable
only by pronunciation and accentuation, and at times
having scarcely these distinguishing features. Secondly,
the words which he adduces to be similar, are wanting
in the very essentials that constitute a relationship, for
in most instances they are not even similar in sound,
a requisite to which more attention ought to be paid in
monosyllabic languages than in those which are polysyllabic.
The few words that in reality are similar are
probably only accidental resemblances, and the question
of relationship between the Otomí and Chinese cannot
be said to have been established as yet.<a id="FNanchor_IXp-14" href="#Footnote_IXp-14" class="fnanchor">[IX'-14]</a></p>

<p>Mr Bringier branches out in another direction in
search of a relationship, and fancies he finds it in the
Cherokee, basing his whole argument on a hypothetical
resemblance of perhaps half a dozen words, which in
fact do not resemble each other at all.<a id="FNanchor_IXp-15" href="#Footnote_IXp-15" class="fnanchor">[IX'-15]</a></p>

<p>Like other monosyllabic tongues the Otomí is rather
difficult to acquire, its pronunciation being rough, guttural,
with frequently occurring nasals and aspirates.<a id="FNanchor_IXp-16" href="#Footnote_IXp-16" class="fnanchor">[IX'-16]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_739">739</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">OTOMÍ GRAMMAR.</p>

<p>As before stated, many words having distinct meanings,
are distinguished only by various sounds, or intonations
of the same vowel; many words even having
the same sound and intonations have different meanings.
The words of this language are of one or two syllables;
a few of them have three. In words compounded of
more than one syllable, each syllable preserves its original
meaning. The words whether noun or verb, are inflexible.
Neither substantive nor adjective nouns have
any gender. The same word may be a substantive,
adjective, verb, and adverb, as in the following sentence;&mdash;<i>na
nho nho ye na nho he nho</i>, which means, the goodness
of man is good and becomes him well. Nouns have
neither declension nor gender, which are expressed either
by distinct words, or by <i>ta</i>, or <i>tza</i>, male, and <i>nsu</i> or
<i>nxu</i>, female;&mdash;<i>tayo</i>, the dog; <i>nxuyo</i>, slut. The particle
<i>na</i> has the property of the article and, prefixed to the
noun, distinguishes the singular. In the plural, <i>ya</i> affixed,
or <i>e</i> prefixed, is substituted. Adjectives are always
placed before substantives;&mdash;<i>ka ye</i>, holy man. Comparatives
are expressed by the words <i>nra</i>, more, and
<i>chu</i>, less;&mdash;<i>nho</i>, good; <i>nra nho</i>, better. Superlatives are
in like manner shown by the word <i>tza</i>, or <i>tze</i>, prefixed,
meaning very much, excessively, exceedingly;&mdash;<i>tza nho</i>,
best; <i>tze ntzo</i>, worst, or very bad. The particle <i>ztzi</i>, or
<i>ztzu</i>, prefixed, marks a diminutive;&mdash;<i>ztzi hensi</i>, a small
paper. In abstract nouns of quality the prefix <i>na</i> is
changed into <i>sa</i>;&mdash;<i>na nho yeh</i>, a good man; <i>sa nho</i>, that
which is good. Personal pronouns are;&mdash;<i>nuga</i>, <i>nugaga</i>,
<i>nugui</i>, I; <i>gui</i>, <i>ki</i>, me, for me; <i>nugué</i>, <i>nûy</i>, thou; <i>y</i>, <i>hi</i>, to
thee, for thee; <i>nunu</i>, he; <i>bi</i>, <i>ba</i>, <i>ki</i>, him, for him, to him;
<i>nugahé</i>, <i>nugagahé</i>, <i>nuguihé</i>, we, or us; <i>nuguégúi</i>, <i>nuguehu</i>,
<i>nûygúi</i>, <i>nûyhu</i>, you, to you; <i>nuyu</i>, they; <i>ma</i>, mine; <i>ni</i>,
thine; <i>na</i>, his.</p>

<p>Verbs are conjugated with the assistance of particles,
which designate tense and person. Every tense has
three persons, also a singular, and a plural. The plural is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_740">740</a></span>
always designated by the syllable <i>hé</i>, we; <i>wi</i>, <i>gúi</i>, or <i>hu</i>,
you; <i>yu</i>, they. All nouns may also be verbs, for the
Otomís, unable to segregate the abstract idea of existence
from the thing existing, confound both and have no
substantive verb;&mdash;<i>nho</i>, good; <i>di nho</i>, I good, or I am
good.</p>

<p>The grammar of the Mazahua dialect is very nearly
the same as that of the Otomí, and I therefore insert
the Lord's Prayer only to illustrate the connection between
the two languages.</p>

<p>North-eastward of the Otomí, is a language called the
Pame, spoken in three distinct dialects; the first in San
Luis de la Paz, in the Sierra Gorda; the second, near
the city of Maiz, in San Luis Potosí; and the third in
Purísima Concepcion de Arnedo, and also in the Sierra
Gorda. I have at hand only the Lord's Prayer in
three dialects; nor can I find mention of any vocabulary
or grammar. It is described as difficult to acquire,
principally on account of the many dialectic variations.<a id="FNanchor_Xp-1" href="#Footnote_Xp-1" class="fnanchor">[X'-1]</a></p>

<p>It will be observed that the third dialect displays
a most singular combination of letters. It is a manifest
absurdity. Pimentel does not mention where he obtained
it, nor does he intimate what sounds are produced from
this huddling of consonants. I give it more as a curiosity
than with the idea that philologists will ever derive
any benefit from it.<a id="FNanchor_Xp-2" href="#Footnote_Xp-2" class="fnanchor">[X'-2]</a></p>

<p>In the Sierra Gorda and in Guanajuato, another language
is mentioned, called the Meco, or Serrano, of
which no specimen but a Lord's Prayer exists:</p>

<p>Mataíge gui bu majetzi, qui sundat too, da guê rit tû
jû da ne pa quecque ni moc canáni, ne si dac-kaá na
moccanzû; tanto na sinfai, tengû, majetzi. Mat tumeje

gatac-je ratentacion; man-aa juêgaje, gat-tit-jov llaizoonfenni.<a id="FNanchor_Xp-3" href="#Footnote_Xp-3" class="fnanchor">[X'-3]</a></p>

<p>Still less is said concerning the languages spoken in
the state of Tamaulipas; of them nothing is known but
the names, and it cannot be ascertained whether they
are correctly classified or not, as no specimens exist.
The languages which I find spoken of are the Yuê, Yemé,
Olive, Janambre, Pisone, and a general one named Tamaulipeco.<a id="FNanchor_Xp-4" href="#Footnote_Xp-4" class="fnanchor">[X'-4]</a></p>

<p>The Tarasco, the principal language of Michoacan, can
be placed almost upon an equality with the Aztec, as
being copious and well finished. It is particularly
sweet-sounding, and on this account has been likened
to the Italian; possessing all the letters of the alphabet.</p>

<p>Each syllable usually contains one consonant and one
vowel; the letter <i>r</i> is frequent.<a id="FNanchor_Xp-5" href="#Footnote_Xp-5" class="fnanchor">[X'-5]</a> From the different
grammars I compile the following:</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_745">745</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">TARASCO GRAMMAR.</p>

<p>In the alphabet there is neither <i>f</i>, <i>v</i>, nor <i>l</i>; no words
begin with the letters <i>b</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>g</i>, and <i>r</i>; <i>k</i>, has a sound
distinct from that of <i>c</i>, being pronounced stronger. The
letter <i>s</i> is often intercalated for euphony; it must be
inserted between <i>h</i> and <i>i</i>, when a word ends with <i>h</i>,
and the next begins with <i>i</i>. At the end of a word it
signifies same, or self; <i>hi</i>, I; <i>his</i>, I myself. When a
word ends in <i>s</i> and the next begins with <i>h</i>, the letter
<i>x</i> is substituted for both. The letter <i>x</i> at the end of a
word indicates the plural. <i>Ph</i> is never pronounced
like <i>f</i>; the <i>h</i> after <i>p</i> only indicates an aspiration of the
vowel which follows:&mdash;<i>p-hica</i>. <i>Hati</i>, third person singular
of the pronoun used in conjugations, may be
converted into <i>ndi</i>. The <i>p</i> immediately following <i>m</i> is
converted into <i>b</i>. The <i>r</i> and <i>t</i> next following <i>n</i> are
converted into <i>d</i>; and <i>e</i> and <i>q</i> next following <i>n</i> are converted
into <i>g</i>. There are three kinds of nouns&mdash;rational,
irrational, and inanimate. The last two are
indeclinable in the singular. The plural of irrational
animals is formed simply by the addition of the particle
<i>echa</i>. Two other particles are used to express the plural
of inanimate things;&mdash;<i>uan</i>, and <i>harandeti</i>, many, much.
Five words of this species use, however, the particle
<i>echa</i> in the plural; <i>uata</i>, mountain; <i>ambocuta</i>, street;
<i>ahchiuri</i>, night; <i>tzipaé</i>, morning; <i>hosqua</i>, star.</p>

<p class="sidenote">MATLALTZINCA GRAMMAR.</p>

<p>West of the valley of Anáhuac, in the ancient kingdom
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_747">747</a></span>
of Michoacan, and in the district which is now
called Toluca, was an independent nation, the Matlaltzincas,
whose language, of which there are several dialects,
notwithstanding the assertion of some writers that
it was connected with or related to the Tarasco, must still
stand as an individual and distinct tongue. Comparisons
may develop a few phonetic similarities, but
otherwise the two do not approach one another in the
least.<a id="FNanchor_Xp-8" href="#Footnote_Xp-8" class="fnanchor">[X'-8]</a></p>

<p>There are twenty-one letters used in the Matlaltzinca
language:&mdash;<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>ch</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>q</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>tz</i>,
<i>th</i>, <i>u</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>. Compounded words are frequently used
and are considered very elegant;&mdash;<i>kimituhoritakimindutzitzi</i>,
to look for something to eat; <i>kituteginchimuthohuinikuhumbi</i>,
I give a good example. Gender is expressed
and there is also a declension. There is a
singular, a dual, and a plural; the dual is designated
by the preposition <i>the</i>;&mdash;<i>huema</i>, the man; <i>thema</i>, the two
men. The plural is designated by the preposition <i>ne</i>;&mdash;<i>nema</i>,
the men; but there are some inanimate substantives
with which this latter preposition is not used.</p>

<p>The personal pronouns are:&mdash;<i>kaki</i>, I; <i>kakuehui</i>, <i>kakuebi</i>,
<i>kakuehebi</i>, we two; <i>kakohuiti</i>, <i>kakehebi</i>, we; <i>kahachi</i>,
thou; <i>kachehui</i>, you two; <i>kachohui</i>, you; <i>inthehui</i>, he;
<i>inthehuehui</i>, they two; <i>inthehue</i>, they. Possessives:&mdash;<i>niteyeh</i>,
mine; <i>kaxniyeh</i>, thine; <i>niyeh inthehui</i>, his.</p>

<p>A language spoken in Toluca, the Ocuiltec, is mentioned
by Sahagun and Grijalua, about which, excepting
the name only, no information can be obtained.<a id="FNanchor_Xp-10" href="#Footnote_Xp-10" class="fnanchor">[X'-10]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">DIALECTS OF THE MIZTEC LANGUAGE.</p>

<p class="p2">Principally in the state of Oajaca, but also in parts
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_749">749</a></span>
of the present states of Puebla and Guerrero, the Miztec
language is spoken even to this day. Of this language
there are many dialects, of which the following
are mentioned as chief;&mdash;the Tepuzculano, the Yangüistlan,
the Miztec bajo, the Miztec alto, the Cuixlahuac,
the Tlaxiaco, the Cuilapa, the Mictlantongo,
the Tamazulapa, the Xaltepec, and the Nochiztlan. As
related to the Miztec, the Chocho, or Chuchon, also an
Oajaca idiom, is mentioned.<a id="FNanchor_Xp-11" href="#Footnote_Xp-11" class="fnanchor">[X'-11]</a> As the Miztecs are generally
classed among the autochthones of Mexico, their
language is considered as of great antiquity, being
spoken of in connection with that of the Ulmecs and
Xicalancas.<a id="FNanchor_Xp-12" href="#Footnote_Xp-12" class="fnanchor">[X'-12]</a> Almost all of the old missionaries complained
of the difficulty of acquiring this tongue and
its many dialects, which necessitated often a threefold
or fourfold study.<a id="FNanchor_Xp-13" href="#Footnote_Xp-13" class="fnanchor">[X'-13]</a></p>

<p>The Miztec may be written by means of the following
letters:&mdash;<i>a</i>, <i>ch</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>j</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>ñ</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>s</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>u</i>, <i>v</i>, <i>x</i>
or <i>ks</i>, <i>gs</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>dz</i>, <i>nd</i>, <i>tn</i>, <i>kh</i>. The pronunciation is very
clear; the <i>h</i> is aspirated; <i>v</i> is as in English; <i>kh</i>, <i>nd</i>,
and <i>tn</i>, are nasal. Long words are of frequent occurrence.
I give two of seventeen syllables each;&mdash;<i>yodoyokavuandisasikandiyosanninahasahan</i>,
to walk stumbling;
and <i>yokuvuihuatinindiyotuvuihuatusindisahata</i>, to conciliate
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_750">750</a></span>
the good graces of a person. Words are compounded
or agglutinated in five different ways;&mdash;First, without
changing either of the component words, as;&mdash;<i>yutnù</i>,
tree; and <i>kuihi</i>, fruit; <i>yutnukuihi</i>, fruit-tree. Second,
one of the component words changes, as;&mdash;<i>huaha</i>, good,
and <i>ñaha</i>, no; <i>ñahuaha</i>, bad. Third, words which are
first divided and cut up, are afterward, so to say,
patched together again. Fourth, one word is intercalated
with another; as;&mdash;<i>yosinindi</i>, I know; <i>mani</i>, an
estimable thing; <i>yosinimanindi</i>, I love or esteem.</p>

<p class="sidenote">MIZTEC GRAMMAR AND LORD'S PRAYERS.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_751">751</a></span></p>

<p>There are many words in this language which express
quite different things, according to the connection
in which they are used, as;&mdash;<i>yondakandi</i>,
I accompany somebody, means also I ask; <i>yoyuhuindi</i>,
I counsel, signifies also, I go to receive somebody
on the road; also, let us go; etc. Reverential terms
are of frequent occurrence, necessitating almost a separate
language when addressing superiors. For instance;&mdash;<i>noho</i>,
teeth; <i>yeknya yuchixa</i>, teeth of a lord;
<i>dzitui</i>, nose; <i>dutuya</i>, nose of a lord; <i>dzoho</i>, ears; <i>tnahaya</i>,
ears of a lord. There is no regular plural,
but plurality is expressed by the word 'many,' or
the number. Personal pronouns are;&mdash;I, speaking to
inferiors or equals, <i>duhu</i>, <i>ndi</i>; I, speaking with superiors,
<i>ñadzaña</i>, <i>ñadza</i>, <i>ñdza</i>; thou, <i>doho</i>, <i>ndo</i>; thou,
used by females speaking to their children, <i>diya</i>, <i>nda</i>;
you, or your honor, <i>disi</i>, <i>maini</i>, <i>ni</i>; he, <i>ta</i>, <i>tay</i>, <i>yukua</i>;
she, <i>ña</i>, (also used by women speaking of men); he
or she, speaking respectfully, <i>ya</i>, <i>iya</i>; we, <i>ndoo</i>; you,
<i>doho</i>; they, <i>ta</i>, <i>tay</i>, <i>yukua</i>. The pronouns, <i>ndi</i>, <i>ndo</i>, <i>ta</i>,
are affixed to the verb; and the pronouns, <i>duhu</i>, <i>doho</i>,
and <i>tai</i>, are prefixed; <i>ñadzaña</i>, is usually prefixed; <i>ñadza</i>
or <i>ndza</i>, affixed; <i>disi</i>, and <i>maini</i>, are generally prefixed,
<i>ni</i> is affixed; <i>diya</i>, is prefixed and <i>ña</i>, <i>ndoo</i>, and <i>ya</i>, are
affixed.</p>

<p>Verbal nouns are formed by prefixing the syllable <i>sa</i>,
or <i>sasi</i>, to the present indicative of the verb. Regarding
the dialects of the Miztec, Pimentel quotes the following
from Father Reyes' grammar. All the dialects may be
grouped into two principal languages, which are those
of Tepuzculula and Yangüitlan. That of Tepuzculula is
the best understood throughout the district of Mizteca.</p>

<p>The Pater Noster in the Tepuzculula dialect is as follows.</p>

<p>For the purpose of illustrating the difference between
the dialects, I insert two other Pater Nosters, the first
of Miztec bajo, and the second of the alto dialect:</p>

<p>Dútundo hiadícani andívi ñacùú hii ña nániní: naquíxidíca
satónixiní: nacúu ndúdu ínìní ñunahívi
yóhò daguatnaha yo cúu ini andivi. Ditàndo itián
itían taxinia nundi vichi: te dandooni cuachindi dagua
tnaha dandoondi naa ni dativi nundi: te maza dáñani
ntziuhu uncaguandi ña dativindi: te cuneguahanindi
nuu nditaca ña unguaha. Duha na cuu Jesus.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_752">752</a></span></p>

<p>Dzutuyo iyoxicani andivi nacui hii ñanánini. Naquixi
xatòniixini. Nacúhui ndudzuinìni uñaiviyóhò,
sahuatna yocúhui ini andivi. Dzitàyo itian itian taxini
nundi vichi: sandoo-ni cuáchiyo, sahuatanha yo
sandondi nanidzativi nundi taun-sayáhani ñacanacahuandi
zadzativindi. Sacacunino ñahani nuu nditaca
ña hunhua. Dzaa nacuu Iya Iesus.<a id="FNanchor_Xp-14" href="#Footnote_Xp-14" class="fnanchor">[X'-14]</a></p>

<p>Another language, said to be connected with the
Miztec is the Amusgo. Wedged in between the Miztec
and Zapotec are several tongues, of which, excepting a
few Lord's Prayers, I find nothing mentioned but the
names; it is not improbable that some of them were
only dialects of either the Miztec or Zapotec. These
are the Mazatec, Cuicatec, and Chinantec, which latter
is described as a very guttural tongue, with a rather
indistinct pronunciation, so that it is difficult to distinguish
the vowels; further there are mentioned the
Chatino, Tlapanec, and Popoluca.<a id="FNanchor_Xp-15" href="#Footnote_Xp-15" class="fnanchor">[X'-15]</a> Orozco y Berra declares
that the following names designate the Popoluca in
different states. Thus the Chocho, Chochona, or Chuchon,
is said by him to have been called&mdash;in Puebla,
the Popoluca; in Guerrero, the Tlapanec; in Michoacan,
the Teco; and in Guatemala, the Pupuluca.<a id="FNanchor_Xp-16" href="#Footnote_Xp-16" class="fnanchor">[X'-16]</a> Of these
languages I have the following Lord's Prayers:</p>

<p class="center p2">
CHOCHO OR CHUCHON.</p>

<p class="sidenote">MAZATEC AND CUICATEC LORD'S PRAYERS.</p>

<p>Of the Mazatec there are two specimens, which do
not appear to accord, thus showing how little regard
was paid to names:</p>

<p>Nadminá Nainá ga tecni gahami, sandumí ili ga
tirrubanajin nanguili. Cuaha catama janimali, jacunit
dic nangui cunit gahami. Niño rrajinna tey quitaha

<p class="p2">Of the Cuicatec there are also two dialects:</p>

<p>Chidao, chicane cheti jubí chintuico ña; cobichi, jubi

<p class="sidenote p2">ZAPOTEC GRAMMAR AND LORD'S PRAYER.</p>

<p class="p2">The ancient kingdom of Zapotecapan, in which the
Zapotec language was spoken, extended from the valley
of Oajaca as far as Tehuantepec. The different dialects
were, the Zaachilla, Ocotlan, Etla, Netzicho, Serrano de
Ixtepec, Serrano de Cajones or Beni-Xono, and Serrano
de Miahuatlan.<a id="FNanchor_Xp-18" href="#Footnote_Xp-18" class="fnanchor">[X'-18]</a> The Zapotec is a more harmonious
language than the Miztec, and is spoken with considerable
elegance, metaphors and parables abounding.<a id="FNanchor_Xp-19" href="#Footnote_Xp-19" class="fnanchor">[X'-19]</a> Yet
it is in some places pronounced indistinctly; so much so
that Juan Córdova, the author of a grammar, complains
that the letters <i>a</i> and <i>o</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>i</i>, <i>o</i> and <i>u</i>, <i>b</i> and <i>p</i>, and
<i>t</i> and <i>r</i>, are often confounded. The <i>h</i> is used only as
an aspirate. The following letters of the alphabet represent
the sounds of the Zapotec: <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>ch</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>k</i>,
<i>l</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>ñ</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>u</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>th</i>. There are also five
diphthongs: <i>æ</i>, <i>&oelig;</i>, <i>ei</i>, <i>ie</i>, <i>ou</i>. The plural is expressed
either by numerals or by adjectives;&mdash;<i>pichina</i>, deer; <i>ziani
pichina</i>, many deer. Like the Aztec, Miztec, and others,
the Zapotec has reverential terms. The personal pronouns
are;&mdash;<i>naa</i>, <i>ya</i>, <i>a</i>, I; <i>lohui</i>, <i>loy</i>, <i>looy</i>, <i>lo</i>, thou;
<i>yobina</i>, your honor (when speaking to superiors); <i>nikani</i>,
<i>nike</i>, <i>nikee</i>, <i>ni</i>, <i>ke</i>, he or they; <i>yobini</i> or <i>yobina</i>, he,
(speaking respectfully); <i>taono</i>, <i>tono</i>, <i>tonoo</i>, <i>tona</i>, <i>no</i>, <i>noo</i>,
we; <i>lato</i>, <i>to</i>, you.</p>

<p>Possessives;&mdash;<i>xitenia</i>, mine; <i>xitenilo</i>, thine; <i>xitenini</i>,
his; <i>xitenitono</i> or <i>xitenino</i>, ours; <i>xitenito</i>, yours. Interrogatives
used with animate beings, are;&mdash;<i>tuxa</i> or <i>tuia</i>, <i>tu</i>
or <i>chu</i>; and with inanimate things: <i>xiikaxa</i>, <i>xiixa</i>, <i>xii</i>;
<i>koota</i> is used for either animate or inanimate objects.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_755">755</a></span></p>

<p>There are four conjugations, which are distinguished
by the particles with which they commence. The first
uses, in the present, <i>ta</i>, in the past, <i>ka</i>, and in the
future, <i>ka</i>; the second has <i>te</i>, <i>pe</i>, and <i>ke</i>; the third, <i>ti</i>,
<i>ko</i>, <i>ki</i>; and if they are passives, <i>ti</i>, <i>pi</i>, <i>ki</i>, or <i>ti</i>, <i>ko</i>, and
<i>ka</i>; the fourth uses <i>to</i>, <i>pe</i>, and <i>ko</i>.</p>

<p>Between the head waters of the Rio Nexapa and Goatzacoalco
the Mije language is spoken. It is described
as guttural and rough, and by some as poor in words,
necessitating auxiliary gestures. The bishop of Oajaca, to
whose diocese they belonged, in a letter to Archbishop
Lorenzana stated that he had a people under him, who
could only converse during daylight, for at night they
could not see their gestures and without these were unable
to understand each other.<a id="FNanchor_Xp-21" href="#Footnote_Xp-21" class="fnanchor">[X'-21]</a> The following alphabet
is used by Pimentel in writing this language;&mdash;<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>ch</i>, <i>e</i>,
<i>h</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>ñ</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>u</i>, <i>v</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>tz</i>. Two and more consonants
frequently follow one another in the same syllable,
as;&mdash;<i>akx</i>, <i>epx</i>, <i>itzp</i>, <i>otzk</i>, <i>mma</i>, <i>mne</i>, <i>mpi</i>, <i>mto</i>, <i>mxu</i>,
etc. Vowels are also frequently double, as;&mdash;<i>kôô</i>, arms;
<i>teikkaa</i>, and <i>tinaak</i>, stomach. In declensions the genitive
is formed by prefixing the letter <i>i</i>;&mdash;<i>xêuh</i>, name;
<i>dios ixêuh</i>, name of God. The plural is formed by the
terminal <i>toch</i>;&mdash;<i>toix</i>, woman; <i>toixtoch</i>, women.</p>

</p>

<p>The languages of the civilized nations of Central
America, being all more or less affiliated, may be not
improperly classified as the Maya-Quiché family, the
Maya constituting the mother tongue. Commencing
in the neighborhood of the river Goazacoalco, thence
extending over Tabasco, Chiapas, Yucatan, Guatemala,
and portions of Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua,
it occupies the same relatively important position in the
south as the Aztec farther north. Besides spreading
out over this immense area, there are two branches still
farther north, isolated from the mother tongue, yet conterminous
to each other, the Huastec and the Totonac of
Tamaulipas and Vera Cruz. Without including the
last mentioned, probably the fullest enumeration of all
these languages, is given by the Licenciado Diego García
de Palacio, in a letter addressed to the King of Spain,
in the year 1576. Omitting the Aztec, which he includes
in his catalogue, his summary is substantially as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_760">760</a></span>
follows. In Chiapas, the Chiapanec, Tloque, Zotzil, and
Zeldal-Quelen; in Soconusco, a tongue which he designates
as the mother language and another called the
Vebetlateca; in Suchitepec and Guatemala, the Mame,
Achi, Guatemaltec, Chinantec, Hutatec, and Chirichota;
in Vera Paz, the Pokonchi, and Caechicolchi; in the
valleys of Acacebastla and Chiquimula, the Tlacacebastla,
and Apay; and in the valley of San Miguel, the Poton,
Taulepa, and Ulua. Other authors mention, in Guatemala
the Quiché, the Cakchiquel, the Zutugil, the Chorti,
the Alaguilac, the Caichi, the Ixil, the Zoque, the
Coxoh, the Chañabal, the Chol, the Uzpanteca, the
Aguacateca, the Quecchi; and in Yucatan, the stock language,
the Maya. Among all these languages thus
enumerated by different authors, it is not at all unlikely
that some have been mentioned twice under different
names.<a id="FNanchor_XIp-1" href="#Footnote_XIp-1" class="fnanchor">[XI'-1]</a> Most, if not all of them, are related to, if indeed
they did not spring from one mother tongue, the
Maya, of which a dialect, called the Tzendal is said to
be the oldest language spoken in any of these countries.
In fact, they all appear to be dialects and variations of
some few tongues of yet greater antiquity, which again
have sprung from the oldest of all, the Maya. This
latter, I may say, forms the linguistic centre, from which
all the others radiate, decreasing in consanguinity according
to the distance from this centre, losing, by intermixture,
and the adoption of foreign words, their
aboriginal forms, until on reaching the outer edge of
the circle, it becomes difficult to trace their connection
with the source from which they sprang.<a id="FNanchor_XIp-2" href="#Footnote_XIp-2" class="fnanchor">[XI'-2]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_761">761</a></span></p>

<p class="sidenote">THE MAYA LANGUAGE IN YUCATAN.</p>

<p>The Maya, with its many affiliations, may be well compared
in its grammatical construction and capacity to the
Aztec. It has in this respect been likened to the ancient
Greek which it is said to resemble in many points. Although
monosyllabic words are of frequent occurrence, it
has not, as is common to monosyllabic languages, many
very harsh and guttural sounds, but is generally called
soft and well-sounding. The dialects spoken on the coast
of Yucatan and near Belize, are the purest and most elegant
of the Maya family, and the greater the distance from
this region, the greater are the variations from the pure
Maya.<a id="FNanchor_XIp-3" href="#Footnote_XIp-3" class="fnanchor">[XI'-3]</a> Some remarkable hypotheses, which, if proven,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_762">762</a></span>
would revolutionize many existing theories, ethnologic
and philologic, have latterly been brought forward by
the Abbé Brasseur de Bourbourg. This gentleman,
who has devoted himself to the study of ancient Central
America and Mexico for many years, and who is
fully conversant with the languages of Yucatan and
Guatemala, the Maya and Quiché, claims to have discovered
a close connection between the Maya, Quiché,
Cakchiquel, Zutugil, and others, with most of the chief
languages of Europe; prominent among which he places
the Greek, but mentions also Latin, French, English,
German, Flemish, Danish, and others. Although on examination
many of the abbé's so-called roots display
similarities, both phonetic and in meaning, with some
European words, still a large majority are evidently
twisted to conform to the writer's ideas, and it will
require not alone further investigations, but unprejudiced
studies, such as are not made for the purpose of
proving any particular hypothesis, to substantiate his
theories. Until such impartial comparisons are made,
and a clearer light thrown upon the subject, these Central
American languages must remain content to be treated as
strangers to those of the old world.<a id="FNanchor_XIp-4" href="#Footnote_XIp-4" class="fnanchor">[XI'-4]</a> Of the languages
previously enumerated I have the following specimens.</p>

<p class="sidenote p2">POKONCHI GRAMMAR.</p>

<p class="p2">Of the Pokonchi Language I have a short grammar,
by Thomas Gage, which has also been used by Vater
and Gallatin. Following are a few of its prominent
features:</p>

<p>Nouns are declined by the aid of particles, of which
there are two kinds, varying accordingly as the word to
be declined commences with a consonant or with a
vowel. For words commencing with a consonant the particles
<i>nu</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>ru</i>, <i>ca</i>, <i>ata</i>, and <i>quitacque</i> are used; and for
those commencing with a vowel, <i>v</i>, <i>av</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>c</i>, or <i>q</i>, <i>ta</i>,
<i>qu</i>, and <i>tacque</i>. These particles are partly prefixed and
partly affixed, as will appear in the following examples.
So the word <i>pat</i>, house, and <i>tat</i>, father, are by Gage declined
in the following manner.</p>

<table summary="Pokonchi" class="tenses">
<tr>
<td>My house</td>
<td class="br">nupat</td>
<td>Our house</td>
<td>capat</td>

<tr>
<td>Thy house</td>
<td class="br">apat</td>

<td>Your father</td>
<td>atatta</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>His father</td>
<td class="br">rutat</td>
<td>Their father</td>
<td>quitattacque</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The declension of the word <i>acun</i>, son, and <i>ixim</i>, corn,
are given by Gage, as follows:</p>

<table summary="Son and Corn" class="tenses">
<tr>
<td>My son</td>
<td class="br">vacun</td>
<td>Our son</td>
<td>cacun</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Thy son</td>
<td class="br">avacun</td>
<td>Your son</td>
<td>avacunta</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td class="br">racun</td>
<td>Their son</td>
<td>cacuntaque</td>
</tr>

<td colspan="4">&nbsp;</td>

<tr>
<td>My corn</td>
<td class="br">vixim</td>
<td>Our corn</td>
<td>quixim</td>

<tr>
<td>Thy corn</td>
<td class="br">avixim</td>
<td>Your corn</td>
<td>avicimta</td>

<td class="br">rixim</td>
<td>Their corn</td>
<td>quiximtacque</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_765">765</a></span></p>

<p>Verbs in like manner change the particles, by means
of which they are conjugated, accordingly as the word
commences with a consonant or a vowel. For those
commencing with a consonant the particles are;&mdash;<i>nu</i>, <i>na</i>,
<i>inru</i>, <i>inca</i>, <i>nata</i>, <i>inquitacque</i>. Thus the word <i>locoh</i>, to love,
is conjugated as follows:</p>

<p>Sometimes the verb I will is added to express the
future;&mdash;<i>inva</i>, I will; <i>nava</i>, thou wilt; <i>inra</i>, he will.</p>

<p>Verbs beginning with a vowel have the following particles;&mdash;<i>ino</i>,
<i>nav</i>, <i>inr</i>, <i>inqu</i>, or <i>inc</i>, <i>nauta</i>, <i>inqu</i> <i>tacque</i>, or
<i>inc tacque</i>. Thus the verb <i>eça</i>, to deliver, is conjugated.</p>

<p class="sidenote p2">MAME CONJUGATION.</p>

<p class="p2">Of the Mame, or Zaklohpakap, the following extract

old man; <i>ahkimikeia</i>, old woman; <i>mamail</i>, old age of a
man; <i>keiail</i>, or <i>ahkimikil</i>, old age of a woman. The
plural of animate beings is expressed by the particle <i>e</i>
prefixed to the word;&mdash;<i>vuinak</i>, person; <i>evuinak</i>, persons;
but it is considered as elegant also to affix the same
<i>e</i>;&mdash;<i>kiahol</i>, son; <i>ekiahole</i>, sons. For inanimate things,
either numerals or adjectives expressing the plural are
used;&mdash;<i>abah</i>, stone; <i>ikoh abah</i>, many stones. Personal
pronouns are;&mdash;<i>ain</i>, I; <i>aia</i>, thou; <i>ahu</i> or <i>ahi</i>, he; <i>ao</i> or
<i>aoio</i>, we; <i>ae</i> or <i>aeie</i>, you; <i>aehu</i> or <i>aehi</i>, they.</p>

<p>Of the Quiché, there is an abundance of material.
The letters used are;&mdash;<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>l</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>p</i>,
<i>q</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>u</i>, <i>v</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>tz</i>, <i>tch</i>. Gender is expressed by prefixing
the noun <i>ixok</i>, woman, to the word, as;&mdash;<i>coh</i>, lion;
<i>ixok coh</i>, lioness; <i>mun</i>, slave; <i>ixok mun</i>, female slave.
The sound <i>ish</i> expressed by the letter <i>x</i> denotes inferiority,
and is therefore frequently used to express the
feminine of inferior beings. <i>U</i> in the Quichè and <i>ru</i> in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_768">768</a></span>
the Cakchiquel are either possessive pronouns or denote
the possession of the word which follows. The particles
<i>re</i> and <i>ri</i> are at times used for the same purpose;&mdash;<i>u chuch
ahpop</i>, the mother of the prince; <i>qui quoxtum tinanit</i>,
the ramparts of the town. Before the vowels <i>a</i>, <i>o</i>, and
<i>u</i>, they are changed to <i>c</i>; and before <i>e</i> and <i>i</i>, to <i>qu</i>. Derivatives
are formed with the preposition <i>ah</i>, either prefixed
or affixed to the primitive noun;&mdash;<i>car</i>, fish; <i>ahcar</i>,
the fisherman; <i>tzih</i>, word; <i>ahtzih</i>, the speaker; etc. No
positive rule can be given for the formation of the
plural, as there are several different methods in use.
The most common appears to be by the affixes <i>ab</i>, <i>eb</i>,
<i>ib</i>, <i>ob</i>, <i>ub</i>;&mdash;<i>beom</i>, merchant; plural, <i>beomab</i>; <i>ixok</i>, woman;
plural, <i>ixokib</i>; <i>ahau</i>, lord; plural, <i>ahauab</i>. In the Cakchiquel
language the last letter <i>b</i> is omitted, as;&mdash;<i>ixokib</i>,
women, in Quiché, is <i>ixoki</i> in Cakchiquel.
With adjectives the syllables <i>ak</i>, <i>tak</i>, <i>ic</i>, <i>tic</i>, etc., are
used instead;&mdash;<i>nim</i>, great; <i>nimak ha</i>, great houses; <i>rihi</i>,
old; <i>rihitak vinak</i>, old people; <i>utz</i>, good; <i>utzic va</i>, good
eatables. Adjectives are always placed before the substantives;&mdash;<i>zak</i>,
white; <i>zaki ha</i>, white house. Substantives
are formed from adjectives by adding one of the
particles, <i>al</i>, <i>el</i>, <i>il</i>, <i>ol</i>, <i>ul</i>;&mdash;<i>nim</i>, great; <i>nimal</i>, the greatness;
<i>zak</i>, white; <i>zakil</i>, the whiteness; <i>utz</i>, good; <i>utzil</i>,
the goodness. These same substantives can be turned
into adjectives again by adding the particle <i>ah</i>;&mdash;<i>nimalah
mak</i>, great sin; <i>utzilah achi</i>, good man. In the same
manner all substantives may be turned into adjectives
by adding one of the particles <i>alah</i>, <i>elah</i>, <i>ilah</i>, <i>olah</i>, <i>ulah</i>,
etc.; <i>ahau</i>, king or lord; <i>ahaualah</i>, royal.</p>

<p>To express the comparative, the present participle of
the verb <i>iqou</i>, to surpass, which is <i>iqouinak</i>, is used,
and sometimes also the word <i>yalacuhinak</i>, from <i>yalacuh</i>,
to exceed. For example;&mdash;<i>nim</i>, great, comparative, <i>iqouinak
chi nim</i>, he who surpasses in greatness; <i>iqouinak
chi nim u hebeliquiil ka xokahau Gapoh maria chiqui vi conohel
ixokib</i>, (literally) surpasses in great beauty our
Lady the Virgin Mary all other women. The superlative
is expressed by the syllable <i>maih</i>, very great or
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_769">769</a></span>
much; <i>nim</i>, great or greatly; <i>tih</i>, <i>xoo</i>, <i>quï</i>, much; all
of which are placed before the word and are followed
by the syllable <i>chi</i>;&mdash;<i>maih chi nim</i>, very great; <i>maih chi
hebel</i>, very fine; <i>maih chi tinamit</i>, very great city; <i>xoo
qatan</i>, very great heat; <i>tih nima ha</i>, very great house.
The adverb <i>lavolo</i> or <i>lolo</i> is also used for the same purpose&mdash;<i>lavolo</i>
or <i>lolo cou ch' a bana</i>, hold it strong.</p>

<p>The names of colors are duplicated to express the superlative,
as;&mdash;<i>rax rax</i>, very green; <i>zak zak</i>, very white.</p>

<p>The reverential syllables in use are <i>lal</i> and <i>la</i>&mdash;<i>lal nu
cahau</i>, your excellency is my father; <i>in alcual la</i>, I am
the son of your excellency.</p>

<p>The prepositions&mdash;<i>ma</i>, <i>man</i>, or <i>mana</i>, and <i>mave</i>, are
negatives. When <i>man</i>, or <i>mana</i>, is used with a verb,
the particle <i>tah</i> must be added;&mdash;<i>man ca v' il-tah</i>, I do
not see. Father Ximenez calls the following irregular
verbs, <i>qo</i>, <i>qoh</i>, or <i>qolic</i>, <i>pa</i>, <i>ux</i>, or <i>uxic</i>; <i>qaz</i>, to live, and

<p>The Zutugil and Cakchiquel appear to bear a closer
relationship to each other, than the Cakchiquel and
Quiché. Some of the principal differences between the
three are the following. The plural of nouns which in
the Quiché is formed by the affixes <i>ab</i>, <i>eb</i>, <i>ob</i>, <i>ib</i>, <i>ub</i>, is
in the Cakchiquel designated by simply affixing the
vowels of the above syllables, and in the Zutugil by the
affixes <i>ay</i>, or <i>i</i>. The pronouns which in the Quiché and
Cakchiquel are <i>in</i>, I, etc., are in the Zutugil doubled,
as;&mdash;<i>in-in</i>, I, etc. The possessive pronouns differ in all
three of the languages. The Quiché has <i>vech</i>, mine;
<i>avecha</i>, thine; <i>rech</i>, his; <i>kech</i>, ours; <i>yvech</i>, yours; <i>quech</i>,
theirs. In the Cakchiquel these are;&mdash;<i>vichin</i>, <i>avichin</i>,
<i>richin</i>, <i>kichin</i>, <i>yvichin</i>, <i>quichin</i>, and the Zutugil changes
the <i>ch</i> of the Cakchiquel into <i>n</i>;&mdash;<i>vixin</i>, <i>avixin</i>, <i>rixin</i>,
<i>kixin</i>, <i>yvixin</i>, <i>quixin</i>. The dative in the Quiché is <i>chuvech</i>,
to me, in the Cakchiquel <i>chuvichin</i>, and in the Zutugil,
<i>chuvixin</i>. Reciprocal pronouns in the Quiché are
<i>vib</i>, <i>avib</i>, <i>rib</i>, <i>kib</i>, <i>yvib</i>, and <i>quib</i>, and in the Zutugil they
are <i>vi</i>, <i>avi</i>, <i>ri</i>, <i>ki</i>, <i>yvi</i>, <i>qui</i>. The verb <i>ganeh</i>, which also
means to love, is in the Cakchiquel and Zutugil conjugated
as follows.</p>

<p>There are also many other words which differ in one
or more letters in the three languages, but it appears
that they are nevertheless so much alike that the different
people speaking them can understand one another.</p>

<p class="sidenote p2">QUICHÉ AND CAKCHIQUEL LORD'S PRAYERS.</p>

<p class="p2">Lord's Prayer in the Quiché:</p>

Chi pe-tah ahauarem la. Chi ban-ta ahauam la, varal

<p class="p2">Of the Maya Grammar, the following is a brief compendium:</p>

<p>The following alphabet is used to write the Maya language:
<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>ç</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>tz</i>, <i>ɔ</i>, <i>cti</i>, <i>ch</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>l</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>o</i>,
<i>p</i>, <i>pp</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>th</i>, <i>u</i>, <i>x</i>.</p>

<p>The letter <i>ç</i> is pronounced like the English <i>z</i>, or as if
for example the word <i>cambeç</i>, were spelled <i>cambez</i>. The
<i>ɔ</i> is pronounced as if spelled <i>dj</i>, <i>ɔib</i> is pronounced as if
written <i>djib</i>, to write; <i>h</i>, not aspirated, and very frequently
omitted; <i>k</i>, rather guttural; <i>pp</i> and <i>p</i>, sharp
and with force; <i>th</i>, hard, at the same time approximating
slightly the English <i>tt</i>. The gender of rational beings
is denoted by the prefixes <i>ah</i>, for masculine, and <i>ix</i>, for
feminine;&mdash;<i>ah cambezah</i>, master; <i>ix cambezah</i>, mistress.
With animals the particles <i>xibil</i>, for males, and <i>chupul</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_774">774</a></span>
for females, is prefixed. An exception to this rule is
the word <i>pal</i>;&mdash;<i>xibil pal</i>, the boy; and <i>chupal pal</i>, the
girl. Nouns form the plural by adding the particle <i>ob</i>;&mdash;<i>ich</i>,
eye; <i>ich ob</i>, eyes. Adjectives ending in <i>nac</i>, in
the plural lose their two last syllables and substitute
for them the syllable <i>lac</i>;&mdash;<i>kakatnác</i>, an idle thing;
<i>kaklác</i>, idle things. When an adjective and substantive
are joined together, the adjective is always placed before
the substantive, but the plural is expressed only in
the substantive;&mdash;man, <i>uinic</i>; good, <i>utzul</i>; <i>utzúl uinicob</i>,
good men. To form the comparative, the last vowel of
the adjective with the letter <i>l</i> added to it is affixed; frequently,
the particle <i>il</i> is simply affixed;&mdash;further, the
pronoun of the third person <i>u</i> or <i>y</i> is always prefixed,
in the comparative;&mdash;<i>tibil</i>, a good thing; <i>ú tibilil</i>, a better
thing; <i>utz</i>, good; <i>yutzil</i>, or <i>yutzul</i>, better; <i>lob</i>, bad; <i>ulobol</i>,
or <i>ulobil</i>, worse; <i>kaz</i>, ugly; <i>ukazal</i>, or <i>ukazil</i>, uglier.
The superlative is expressed by the particle <i>hach</i>, which
is prefixed;&mdash;<i>lob</i>, bad; <i>hachlob</i>, very bad. <i>Il</i> added to
nouns and adjectives serves to make them abstracts,
<i>uinic</i>, man; <i>uinicil</i>, humanity.</p>

<p class="sidenote">MAYA CONJUGATIONS.</p>

<p>There are four kinds of pronouns used in the Maya,
all of which are used in conjugating verbs. But the
two last are also used, united with nouns, or as possessive
pronouns, and never alone, or as absolute pronouns.</p>

<p>To the two languages the Huaztec and Totonac spoken
respectively in the states of Tamaulipas and Vera Cruz,
great antiquity is ascribed. I include them both in this
chapter, and classify them with the Maya family; the
Huaztec because its relationship has already been satisfactorily
established by Vater and his successors, and
the Totonac on the statements of Sahagun and other
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_777">777</a></span>
good authorities.<a id="FNanchor_XIp-10" href="#Footnote_XIp-10" class="fnanchor">[XI'-10]</a> Of both of these languages I insert
some grammatical notes. The Totonac is divided into
four principal dialects, named respectively that of the
Sierra Alta or Tetikilhati, that of Xalpan y Pontepec,
or Chakahuaxti, the Ipapana and the Naolingo or Tatimolo.
The following grammar refers specially to the
last dialect.</p>

<p class="sidenote">TOTONAC GRAMMAR.</p>

<p>The letters used are <i>a</i>, <i>ch</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>l</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>t</i>,
<i>u</i>, <i>v</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>tz</i>, <i>lh</i>. Compounded or agglutinated words
are of frequent occurrence; they seem to be joined without
any particular system, although it appears that
the last letter is oftentimes omitted. The following

<p>The descriptions or grammatical remarks of Vater
and Pimentel, vary in many points. For instance,
Vater says that the letters <i>k</i> and <i>v</i> are not used in this
language, while Pimentel mentions them both as being
used. The expression of the plural is also given differently
by both, as are also several other points.<a id="FNanchor_XIp-11" href="#Footnote_XIp-11" class="fnanchor">[XI'-11]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote p2">HUAZTEC GRAMMAR.</p>

<p class="p2">From the grammar of Carlos de Tapia Zenteno,
which was also used by Gallatin and Pimentel, I offer
the following remarks on the Huaztec:</p>

<p>The letters used in writing this language are: <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>ch</i>,
<i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>j</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>l</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>u</i>, <i>v</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>tz</i>. The
pronunciation is soft. Gender is denoted by the addition
of the words <i>imik</i>, man, and <i>uxum</i>, woman;&mdash;<i>tzalle</i>,
king; <i>uxumtzalle</i>, queen; <i>tzejelinik</i>, young man;
<i>tzejeluxum</i>, young girl. The affix <i>chick</i> is used to express
the plural;&mdash;<i>atik</i>, son; <i>atikchick</i>, sons; but there are a
few exceptions to this rule. Diminutives are expressed
by the preposition <i>chichick</i>, as;&mdash;<i>te</i>, tree; <i>chichikte</i>, small
tree. In some cases the preposition <i>tzakam</i>, or the affix
<i>il</i>, is used for this purpose. In the superlative the syllable
<i>le</i> is used before the word, as;&mdash;<i>pullik</i>, great;
<i>lepullik</i>, very great. Personal pronouns;&mdash;<i>nana</i>, I; <i>tata</i>,
thou; <i>jaja</i>, he; <i>huahua</i>, we; <i>xaxa</i>, you; <i>baba</i>, they.</p>

<p>In Honduras there is a long list of tribal names,
to each of which is attributed a distinct tongue. Vocabularies
have been taken of three or four only,
and one, spoken on the Mosquito coast, has had its
grammatical structure reduced to writing. It is therefore
impossible to make comparisons and therefrom to
determine how far their number might be reduced by
classification. The first which I introduce is generally
conceded to have been imported. It is the Carib,
spoken on the shores of the bay of Honduras and on
the adjacent islands, and has been proven to be almost
identically the same as the one spoken on the West
India Islands. From Cape Honduras to the Rio San
Juan, and extending inland as far as Black River,
the Mosquito language is in general use. Of it I
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_783">783</a></span>
shall insert a few grammatical remarks. In the
Poya Mountains a like-named tongue is spoken; on
the headwaters of the Patook River is the Towka, and
on the Rio Secos, the Seco. Further in the mountains,
near the boundary of Nicaragua, and extending into
that state are the Valiente and Rama, said to be both
separate tongues; and in the interior of the state
there are the Cookra and Woolwa, the latter spoken
in the province of Chontales. Others mentioned are
the Tonglas, the Lenca, the Smoo, the Teguaca, the
Albatuina, the Jara, the Taa, the Gaula, the Motuca,
the Fantasma, and the Sambo. Of these nothing but
the names can be given. The oldest authorities mention,
as a principal language the Chontal, the name
of a people and language met in many variations
in almost every state from Mexico to Nicaragua. As
there are no specimens of this language existing, it is
impossible to say whether one people and language
extended through all this territory or whether certain
wild tribes were designated by this general name, as,
according to Molina's Mexican dictionary, <i>chontalli</i>
means stranger or foreigner; and <i>popoluca</i>, which
seems to be also used like chontalli, is defined as
barbarian, or man of another nation and language. I
am therefore of the opinion that no such nations as
Chontals or Popolucas exist, but that these names were
employed by the more civilized nations to designate
people speaking other and barbarous tongues.<a id="FNanchor_XIIp-1" href="#Footnote_XIIp-1" class="fnanchor">[XII'-1]</a></p>

<p class="sidenote">MOSQUITO ADJECTIVES AND DECLENSIONS.</p>
<p>Of the Mosquito language, which is understood throughout
the whole Mosquito Coast, and of which I here give
a few grammatical remarks, Mr Squier remarks that "it is
not deficient in euphony, although defective in grammatical
power."<a id="FNanchor_XIIp-2" href="#Footnote_XIIp-2" class="fnanchor">[XII'-2]</a> There is but one article, the numeral adjective
<i>kumi</i>, one, used also for a and an. The adjectives
are few in number, having no uniform termination, and
are discovered only by their signification, except when
participles, when they always terminate in <i>ra</i> or <i>n</i>.
Adjectives form the comparative by adding <i>kara</i> to the
positive and the superlative by adding <i>poli</i> except in two
words, <i>uia</i> and <i>silpe</i>, which have distinct words for each
degree of comparison, thus;&mdash;<i>silpe</i>, small; <i>uria</i>, smaller;
<i>katara</i>, smallest; <i>uia</i>, much; <i>kara</i>, more; <i>poli</i>, most.
Comparison is usually formed in the manner following;&mdash;<i>yamne</i>,
good; <i>yamne kara</i>, better; <i>yamne poli</i>, best;
<i>konra</i>, strong; <i>konra kara</i>, stronger; <i>konra poli</i>, strongest.</p>

<p>In composition, to express excess or diminution, comparison
is sometimes formed in this manner;&mdash;<i>Jan almuk,
Samuel almuk apia</i>: John is old, Samuel is not
old.</p>

<p>The gender is commonly marked by adding <i>waikna</i>
for the male and <i>mairen</i> for the female, or, for beasts,
<i>wainatka</i> for the male, and <i>mairen</i>, as before, for the
female. Thus;&mdash;<i>lupia waikna</i>, a son; <i>lupia mairen</i>, a
daughter; <i>bip wainatka</i>, a bull; <i>bip mairen</i>, a cow. In
nouns relating to the human species the plural is
formed by adding <i>nani</i> to the singular; as;&mdash;<i>waikna</i>,
a man; <i>waikna nani</i>, men; <i>yapte</i>, mother; <i>yapte nani</i>,
mothers. Other nouns have the plural the same as
the singular, although sometimes a plural is formed by
adding <i>ra</i> to the singular;&mdash;<i>inska</i>, a fish; <i>inskara</i>, fishes.</p>

<p>There are four cases, distinguished by their terminations,

<p>As a specimen of this language I have the following
love song:</p>

<p>Dear girl, I am going far from thee. When shall
we meet again to wander together on the sea-side? I
feel the sweet sea-breeze blow its welcome on my cheek.
I hear the distant rolling of the mournful thunder. I
see the lightning flashing on the mountain's top, and
illuminating all things below, but thou art not near me.
My heart is sad and sorrowful; farewell! dear girl,

<p>Besides the Aztec, which I have already spoken of
in a previous chapter, there were four distinct languages
spoken in Nicaragua:&mdash;The Coribici, Chorotega, Chontal,
and Orotiña.<a id="FNanchor_XIIp-6" href="#Footnote_XIIp-6" class="fnanchor">[XII'-6]</a> Of the Orotiña, which Mr Squier
calls the Nagrandan, I have the following grammatical
notes.</p>

<p>Neither articles nor prepositions are expressed. The
plural is formed by the affix <i>nu</i>;&mdash;<i>ruscu</i>, bird; <i>ruscunu</i>,
birds. Comparatives and superlatives are expressed
by <i>mah</i>, better or more, and <i>pooru</i> or <i>puru</i>, best
or most;&mdash;<i>meheña</i>, good; <i>ma-meheña</i>, better; <i>puru-meheña</i>,
best. Diminutives, or deficiency, are expressed by <i>ai</i>
or <i>mai</i>;&mdash;<i>ai-meheña</i> or <i>mai-meheña</i>, bad or lacking good.</p>

<p>On the isthmus of Darien there is nothing to be
mentioned but the names of tongues said to have been
spoken there, and of specimens nothing but a few
scanty vocabularies exist. Oviedo, speaking of Nicaragua,
Costa Rica, and the ancient province of Tierra
Firme, thinks there were as many as seventy-two distinct
tongues spoken in that region. He specially
mentions the Coiba, the Burica, and the Paris.<a id="FNanchor_XIIp-10" href="#Footnote_XIIp-10" class="fnanchor">[XII'-10]</a> Andagoya
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_794">794</a></span>
speaks of a distinct language in the province of
Acla; another called the Cueva as spoken in the provinces
of Comogre and Biruqueta, on Pearl Island, about
the gulf of San Miguel, and in the province of Coiba;
at Nombre de Dios the Chuchura; to each of the provinces
of Tobreytrota, Nata, Chiru, Chame, Paris, Escoria,
Chicacotra, Sangana, and Guarara, a distinct language
is assigned.<a id="FNanchor_XIIp-11" href="#Footnote_XIIp-11" class="fnanchor">[XII'-11]</a> Another tongue spoken of by an
old writer is that of the Simerones.<a id="FNanchor_XIIp-12" href="#Footnote_XIIp-12" class="fnanchor">[XII'-12]</a> To the different
surveying and exploring expeditions of later years we
are indebted for a few notes on the languages spoken
in Darien at this day. The Tules, Dariens, Cholos,
Dorachos, Savanerics, Cunas, and Bayamos, are new
names not mentioned by any of the older writers; of
some of them vocabularies have been taken, but otherwise
we are left in darkness.<a id="FNanchor_XIIp-13" href="#Footnote_XIIp-13" class="fnanchor">[XII'-13]</a></p>

<p>Although from a perusal of what has here been gathered
we might wish to know more of the weird imaginings
that floated through the minds of these peoples,
and to follow further the interminable intermixture of
tongues and dialects, spoken, grunted, and gestured between
the Arctic Ocean and the Atrato River, we must
content ourselves with what we have. I have gathered
and given in this volume all that I have been able to
find; and from the readiness with which the Americans
were wont to adopt the dogmas and creeds of Europeans,
supernatural conceptions supposedly superior to
their own, and insist upon their being aboriginal, and
from the rapid and bewildering changes that so quickly
mar and destroy the original purity of tongues, there is
little hope of our learning further from living lips, or
of our ever being able to study these things from the
scattered and degraded remnants of the people themselves.</p>

<p class="sidenote">CONCLUSION.</p>

<p>He who carefully examines the Myths and Languages
of the aboriginal nations inhabiting the Pacific States,
cannot fail to be impressed with the similarity between
them and the beliefs and tongues of mankind elsewhere.
Here is the same insatiate thirst to know the unknowable,
here are the same audacious attempts to tear asunder the
veil, the same fashioning and peopling of worlds, laying
out and circumscribing of celestial regions, and manufacturing,
and setting up, spiritually and materially, of
creators, man and animal makers and rulers, everywhere
manifest. Here is apparent what would seem to be the
same inherent necessity for worship, for propitiation, for
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_796">796</a></span>
purification, or a cleansing from sin, for atonement and
sacrifice, with all the symbols and paraphernalia of natural
and artificial religion. In their speech the same
grammatical constructions are seen with the usual variations
in form and scope, in poverty and richness, which
are found in nations, rude or cultivated, everywhere.
Little as we know of the beginning and end of things,
we can but feel, as fresh facts are brought to light and
new comparisons made between the races and ages of
the earth, that humanity, of whatsoever origin it may
be or howsoever circumstanced, is formed on one model,
and unfolds under the influence of one inspiration.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_II-1" href="#FNanchor_II-1"><span class="label">[II-1]</span></a> In Vienna in 1857, the book now best known as the Popol Vuh
was first brought to the notice of European scholars, under the following
title: <span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><i>Las Historias del Origen de los Indios de esta Provincia de Guatemala,
traducidas de la Lengua Quiché al Castellano para mas Comodidad de los
Ministros del S. Evangelio, por el R. P. F. Francisco Ximenez, cura doctrinero
por el real patronato del Pueblo de S. Thomas Chuila</i>.&mdash;<i>Exactamente segun
el texto español del manuscrito original que se halla en la biblioteca de la
Universidad de Guatemala, publicado por la primera vez, y aumentado con
una introduccion y anotaciones por el Dr C. Scherzer.</i></span> What Dr Scherzer
says in a paper read before the Vienna Academy of Sciences, Feb. 20th,
1856; and repeats in his introduction, about its author, amounts to this: In
the early part of the 18th century Francisco Ximenez, a Dominican Father of
great repute for his learning and his love of truth, filled the office of curate
in the little Indian town of Chichicastenango in the highlands of Guatemala.
Neither the time of his birth nor that of his death can be exactly ascertained,
but the internal evidence of one of his works shows that he was engaged
upon it in 1721. He left many manuscripts, but it is supposed that
the unpalatable truths some of them contain with regard to the ill-treatment
of the Indians by the colonial authorities sufficed, as previously in the case
of Las Casas, to ensure their partial destruction and total suppression. What
remains of them lay long hid in an obscure corner of the Convent of the
Dominicans in Guatemala, and passed afterwards, on the suppression of all
the religious orders, into the library of the University of San Carlos (Guatemala).
Here Dr Scherzer discovered them in June 1854, and carefully
copied, and afterwards published as above the particular treatise
with which we are now concerned. This, according to Father Ximenez himself,
and according to its internal evidence, is a translation of a <i>literal</i> copy of
an original book, written by one or more Quichés, in the Quiché language, in
Roman letters, after the Christians had occupied Guatemala, and after the
real original Popol Vuh&mdash;National Book&mdash;had been lost or destroyed&mdash;literally,
was no more to be seen&mdash;and written to <i>replace</i> that lost book. <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">'Quise
trasladar todas las historias <i>á la letra</i> de estos indios, y tambien traducirla
en la lengua castellana.'</span> <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">'Esto escribiremos ya en la ley de Dios en la
cristiandad los sacaremos, porque ya no hay libro comun, original donde
verlo, <i>Ximenez</i>, <i>Hist. Ind. Guat.</i>, pp. 1, 4, 5.</span> <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">'Voilà ce que nous écrirons depuis
(qu'on a promulgué) la parole de Dieu, et en dedans du Christianisme;
nous le reproduirons, parce qu'on ne voit plus ce Livre national,'</span> <span lang="qu" xml:lang="qu">'Vae
x-chi-ka tzibah chupan chic u chabal Dios, pa Christianoil chic; x-chi-k'-elezah,
rumal ma-habi chic ilbal re Popol-Vuh,'</span> <i>Brasseur de Bourbourg</i>, <i>Popol
Vuh</i>, p. 5. The evidence that the author was Quiché will be found in
the numerous passages scattered through the narrative in which he
speaks of the Quiché nation, and of the ancestors of that nation as 'our
people,' 'our ancestors,' and so on. We pass now to what the Abbé Brasseur
de Bourbourg has to say about the book. He says that Ximenes
'discovered this document, in the last years of the 17th century.' In
1855, at Guatemala, the abbé first saw Ximenez' manuscript containing this
work. The manuscript contained the Quiché text and the Spanish curate's
translation of that text. Brasseur de Bourbourg copied both at that time, but
he was dissatisfied with the translation, believing it to be full of faults owing
to the prejudices and the ignorance of the age in which it was made, as well
as disfigured by abridgments and omissions. So in 1860 he settled himself
among the Quichés and by the help of natives joined to his own practical
knowledge of their language, he elaborated a new and literal translation,
(<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aussi littérale qu'il a été possible de la faire</span>). We seem justified then on
the whole in taking this document for what Ximenez and its own evidence
declare it to be, namely, a reproduction of an older work or body of Quiché
traditional history, written because that older work had been lost and was
likely to be forgotten, and written by a Quiché not long after the Spanish
conquest. One consequence of the last fact would seem to be that a tinge of
biblical expression has, consciously or unconsciously to the Quiché who
wrote, influenced the form of the narrative. But these coincidences may be
wholly accidental, the more as there are also striking resemblances to expressions
in the Scandinavian Edda and in the Hindoo Veda. And even if they
be not accidental, 'much remains,' adopting the language and the conclusion
of Professor Max Müller, 'in these American traditions which is so
different from anything else in the national literatures of other countries,
that we may safely treat it as the genuine growth of the intellectual soil of
America.' <i>Chips from a German Workshop</i>, vol. i., p. 328. For the foregoing,
as well as further information on the subject see:&mdash;<i>Brasseur de Bourbourg</i>,
<i>Popol Vuh</i>, pp. 5-31, 195-231; <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>S'il existe des Sources de l'Hist. Prim.</i></span>,
pp. 83-7; <i>Hist. des Nat. Civ.</i>, tom. i., pp. 47-61; <i>Ximenez</i>, <i>Hist. Ind. Guat.</i>,
pp. 5-15; <i>Scherzer</i>, in <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Sitzungsberichte der Akademie der Wissenschaften Wien</i></span>,
20th Feb., 1856; <i>Helps' Spanish Conquest</i>, vol. iv., pp. 455-6. Professor
Müller in his essay on the Popol Vuh, has in one or two places misunderstood
the narrative. There was no such creation of man as that he gives
as the second, while his third creation is the second of the original.
Again, he makes the four Quiché ancestors to be the progenitors of
<i>all tribes both white and black</i>; while they were the parents of the Quiché
and kindred races only. The course of the legend brings us to tribes of a
strange blood, with which these four ancestors and their people were often
at war. The narrative is, however, itself so confused and contradictory
at points, that it is almost impossible to avoid such things; and, as a
whole, the views of Professor Müller on the Popol Vuh seem just and well
considered. Baldwin, <i>Ancient America</i>, pp. 191-7, gives a mere dilution of
Professor Müller's essay, and that without acknowledgment.</p>

<p class="footnote">This passage is rendered by the Abbé Brasseur de Bourbourg thus: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">'Voici
le récit comme quoi tout était en suspens, tout était calme et silencieux;
tout était immobile, tout était paisible, et vide était l'immensité des cieux.
Voilà donc la première parole et le premier discours. Il n'y avait pas encore
un seul homme, pas un animal, pas d'oiseaux, de poissons, d'écrevisses,
de bois, de pierre, de fondrières, de ravins, d'herbe ou de bocages: seulement
le ciel existait. La face de la terre ne se manifestait pas encore: seule la
mer paisible était et tout l'espace des cieux. Il n'y avait encore rien qui fît
corps, rien qui se cramponnât à autre chose: rien qui se balançât, qui fît (le
moindre) frôlement, qui fît (entendre) un son dans le ciel. Il n'y avait rien
qui existât debout; (il n'y avait) que l'eau paisible, que la mer calme et seule
dans ses bornes; car il n'y avait rien qui existât. Ce n'était que l'immobilité
et le silence dans les ténèbres, dans la nuit.' <i>Popol Vuh</i>, p. 7.</span></p>

<p class="footnote">And by Francisco Ximenez thus: <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">'Este es su ser dicho cuando estaba suspenso

conserver, comme chez les chrétiens, les reliques des héros de la patrie: on
enveloppait leurs os avec des pierres précieuses dans un paquet d'étoffes
auquel on donnait le nom de Tlaquimilolli; ces paquets demeuraient à jamais
fermés et on les déposait au fond des sanctuaires où on les conservait
comme des objects sacrés.' <i>Nouvelles Annales des Voyages</i>, 1858, tom. iv., p.
268.</span> One of these 'bundles,' was given up to the Christians by a Tlascaltec
some time after the conquest. It was reported to contain the remains of
Camaxtli, the chief god of Tlascala. The native historian, Camargo, describes
it as follows: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">'Quand on défit le paquet où se trouvaient les cendres
de l'idole Camaxtle, on y trouva aussi un paquet de cheveux blonds, ...
on y trouva aussi une émeraude, et de ses cendres on avait fait une pâte,
en les pétrissant avec le sang des enfants que l'on avait sacrifiés.' <i>Hist. de
Tlaxcallan</i>; in <i>Nouvelles Annales des Voy.</i>, 1843, tom. xcix., p. 179.</span></p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_II-11" href="#FNanchor_II-11"><span class="label">[II-11]</span></a> Even supposing there were no special historical reasons for making this
distinction, it seems convenient that such a division should be made in a
country where the distinction of classes was so marked as in Mexico. As
Reads puts the case, <i>Martyrdom of Man</i>, p. 177, 'In those countries where
two distinct classes of men exist, the one intellectual and learned, the other
illiterate and degraded, there will be in reality two religions, though nominally
there may be only one.'</p>

so that I am well inclined to agree with Müller, <i>Amerikanische Urreligionen</i>,

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_II-19" href="#FNanchor_II-19"><span class="label">[II-19]</span></a> Here, as elsewhere in this legend we follow Andres de Olmos' account as
given by Mendieta. Sahagun, however differs from it a good deal in places.
At this point for example, he mentions some notable personages who guessed
right about the rising of the sun:&mdash;<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">'Otros se pusieron á mirar ácia el oriente,
y digeron aquí, de esta parte ha de salir el Sol. El dicho de estos fué verdadero.
Dicen que los que miraron ácia el Oriente, fueron Quetzalcoatl, que
tambien se llama Ecatl, y otro que se llama Totec, y por otro nombre Anaoatlytecu,
y por otro nombre Tlatavictezcatlipuca, y otros que se llaman Minizcoa,'</span>
or as in Kingsborough's edition, <i>Mex. Antiq.</i>, vol. vii., p. 186. <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">'Por
otro nombre Anaoatl y Tecu, y por otro nombre Tlatavictezcatlipuca, y otros
que se llaman Mimizcoa, que son inumerables; y cuatro mugeres, la una se
llama Tiacapan, la otra Teicu, la tercera Tlacoeoa, la cuarta Xocoyotl.' <i>Sahagun</i>,
<i>Hist. Gen.</i>, tom. ii., lib. viii., p. 248.</span></p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_II-20" href="#FNanchor_II-20"><span class="label">[II-20]</span></a> Besides differences of authorities already noticed, I may add that Sahagun
describes the personage who became the sun&mdash;as well as him who,
as we shall soon see, became the moon&mdash;as belonging before his transformation
to the number of the gods, and not as one of the men who served
them. Further, in recounting the death of the gods, Sahagun says that to
the Air, Ecatl, Quetzalcoatl, was alloted the task of killing the rest; nor does
it appear that Quetzalcoatl killed himself. As to Xolotl, he plays quite a
cowardly part in this version; trying to elude his death, he transformed himself
into various things, and was only at last taken and killed under the form
of a fish called <i>Axolotl</i>.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_II-21" href="#FNanchor_II-21"><span class="label">[II-21]</span></a> This kind of idol answers evidently to the mysterious 'Envelope' of

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_II-22" href="#FNanchor_II-22"><span class="label">[II-22]</span></a> Besides the Chimalpopoca manuscript, the earliest summaries of the
Mexican creation-myths are to be found in <i>Mendieta</i>, <i>Hist. Ecles.</i>, pp. 77-81;

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_II-23" href="#FNanchor_II-23"><span class="label">[II-23]</span></a> <i>Ixtlilxochitl</i>, <i>Hist. Chichimeca</i> in <i>Kingsborough's Mex. Antiq.</i>, vol. ix., pp.
205-6. The same author, in his <i>Relaciones</i>, <i>Ib.</i> pp. 321-2, either through
his own carelessness or that of a transcriber, transposes the second and
third Ages. To see that it is an oversight of some sort, we have but to pass
to the summary he gives at the end of these same <i>Relaciones</i>, <i>Ib.</i>, p. 459,
where the account is again found in strict agreement with the version given
in the text. Camargo, <i>Hist. de Tlax.</i> in <i>Nouvelles Annales des Voy.</i>, tom.
xcix., 1843, p. 132, giving as we may suppose the Tlascaltec version of the
general Mexican myth, agrees with Ixtlilxochitl as to the whole number of
Ages, following, however, the order of the error above noticed in the <i>Relaciones</i>.
The Tlascaltec historian, moreover, affirms that only two of these
Ages are past, and that the third and fourth destructions are yet to come.
M. Ternaux-Compans, <i>Nouvelles Annales des Voy.</i>, tom. lxxxvi., 1840, p. 5,
adopts this Tlascaltec account as the general Mexican tradition; he is followed
by Dr. Prichard, <i>Researches</i>, vol. v., pp. 360-1. Dr. Prichard cites
Bradford as supporting the same opinion, but erroneously, as Bradford, <i>Am.
Antiq.</i>, p. 328, follows Humboldt. Boturini, <i>Idea de una Hist.</i>, p. 3. and Clavigero,
<i>Storia Ant. del Messico</i>, tom. ii., p. 57, agree exactly with the text. The
Abbé Brasseur de Bourbourg also accepts the version of three past destructions.
<i>S'il existe des Sources de l'Hist. Prim.</i>, pp. 26-7. Professor J. G. Müller,
<i>Amerikanische Urreligionen</i>, pp. 510-12, admits that the version of three
past destructions and one to come, as given in the text, and in the order there
given, 'seems to be the most ancient Mexican version;' though he decides to
follow Humboldt, and adopts what he calls the 'latest and fullest form of the
myth.' The <i>Spiegazione delle Tavole del Codice Mexicano</i> [Vaticano] contradicts
itself, giving first two past destructions, and farther on four, <i>Kingsborough's
Mex. Antiq.</i>, vol. v., pp. 163-7; as does also the <i>Explic. del Codex Telleriano-Remensis</i>,
<i>Ib.</i>, pp. 134-6. Kingsborough himself seems to favor the idea of
three past destructions and four ages in all; see <i>Mex. Antiq.</i>, vol. vi., p. 171,
note. Gomara, <i>Hist. Mex.</i>, fol. 297-8; Leon y Gama, <i>Dos Piedras</i>, parte i.,
pp. 94-5; Humboldt, <i>Vues</i>, tom. ii., pp. 118-129; Prescott, <i>Conq. of Mex.</i>,
vol. i., p. 61; Gallatin, in <i>Am. Ethnol. Soc., Transact.</i>, vol. i., p. 325&mdash;describe
four past destructions and one yet to come, or five Ages, and
the Chimalpopoca MS., see <a href="#Footnote_II-13">note 13</a>, seems also to favor this opinion.
Lastly, Mendieta, <i>Hist. Ecles.</i>, p. 81, declares that the Mexicans believe in
five Suns, or Ages, in times past; but these suns were of inferior quality, so
that the soil produced its fruits only in a crude and imperfect state. The
consequence was that in every case the inhabitants of the world died through
the eating of divers things. This present and sixth Sun was good, however,
and under its influence all things were produced properly. Torquemada&mdash;who
has, indeed, been all along appropriating, by whole chapters, the so
long inedited work of Mendieta; and that, if we believe Icazbalceta, <i>Hist.
Ecles.</i>, <i>Noticias del Autor.</i>, pp. xxx. to xlv., under circumstances of peculiar
turpitude&mdash;of course gives also five past Ages, repeating Mendieta word for
word with the exception of a single 'la.' <i>Monarq. Ind.</i>, tom. ii., p. 79.</p>

A careful comparison of the passages given above will show that this whole
story of the escape of Coxcox and his wife in a boat from a great deluge,
and of the distribution by a bird of different languages to their descendants,
rests on the interpretation of certain Aztec paintings, containing supposed
pictures of a flood, of Coxcox and his wife, of a canoe or rude vessel
of some kind, of the mountain Culhuacan, which was the Mexican Ararat,
and of a bird distributing languages to a number of men. Not one of
the earliest writers on Mexican mythology, none of those personally familiar
with the natives and with their oral traditions as existing at the
time of, or immediately after the conquest, seems to have known this
legend; Olmos, Sahagun, Motolinia, Mendieta, Ixtlilxochitl, and Camargo,
are all of them silent with regard to it. These facts must give rise to grave
suspicions with regard to the accuracy of the commonly accepted version,
notwithstanding its apparently implicit reception up to this time by the most
critical historians. These suspicions will not be lessened by the result of
the researches of Don José Fernando Ramirez, Conservator of the Mexican
National Museum, a gentleman not less remarkable for his familiarity with
the language and antiquities of Mexico than for the moderation and calmness of
his critical judgments, as far as these are known. In a communication dated
April, 1858, to Garcia y Cubas, <i>Atlas Geográfico, Estadístico e Histórico de la Republica
Mejicana</i>, entrega 29, speaking of the celebrated Mexican picture
there for the first time, as he claims, accurately given to the public&mdash;Sigüenza's
copy of it, as given by Gemelli Carreri, that given by Clavigero in his <i>Storia del
Messico</i>, that given by Humboldt in his <i>Atlas Pittoresque</i>, and that given by
Kingsborough being all incorrect&mdash;Señor Ramirez says:&mdash;'The authority of
writers so competent as Sigüenza and Clavigero imposed silence on the incredulous,
and after the illustrious Baron von Humboldt added his irresistible
authority, adopting that interpretation, nobody doubted that "the traditions
of the Hebrews were found among the people of America;" that, as the wise
Baron thought, "their Coxcox, Teocipactli, or Tezpi is the Noah, Xisutrus,
or Menou of the Asiatic families;" and that "the Cerro of Culhuacan is the
Ararat of the Mexicans." Grand and magnificent thought, but unfortunately
only a delusion. The blue square No. 1, with its bands or obscure lines
of the same color, cannot represent the terrestrial globe covered with the
waters of the flood, because we should have to suppose a repetition of the
same deluge in the figure No. 40, where it is reproduced with some of its
principal accidents. Neither, for the same reason, do the human heads and
the heads of birds which appear to float there, denote the submerging of men
and animals, for it would be necessary to give the same explanation to those
seen in group No. 39. It might be argued that the group to the left (of
No. 1), made up of a human head placed under the head of a bird, represented
phonetically the name Coxcox, and denoted the Aztec Noah; but the
group on the right, formed of a woman's head with other symbolic figures
above it, evidently does not express the name Xochiquetzal, which is said to
have been that of his wife.... Let us now pass on to the dove giving tongues
to the primitive men who were born mute. The commas which seem to
come from the beak of the bird there represented, form one of the most complex
and varied symbols, in respect to their phonetic force, which are found
in our hieroglyphic writing. In connection with animated beings they
designate generically the emission of the voice.... In the group before us they
denote purely and simply that the bird was singing or speaking&mdash;to whom?&mdash;to
the group of persons before it, who by the direction of their faces and
bodies show clearly and distinctly the attention with which they listened.
Consequently the designer of the before-mentioned drawing for Clavigero,
pre-occupied with the idea of signifying by it the pretended confusion of
tongues, changed with his pencil the historic truth, giving to these figures
opposite directions. Examining attentively the inexactitudes and errors of
the graver and the pencil in all historical engravings relating to Mexico, it is
seen that they are no less numerous and serious than those of the pen. The
interpretations given to the ancient Mexican paintings by ardent imaginations
led away by love of novelty or by the spirit of system, justify to a certain
point the distrust and disfavor with which the last and most distinguished
historian of the Conquest of Mexico (W. H. Prescott) has treated this
interesting and precious class of historical documents.' Señor Ramirez goes
on thus at some length to his conclusions, which reduce the original painting
to a simple record of a wandering of the Mexicans among the lakes of the
Mexican valley&mdash;that journey beginning at a place 'not more than nine
miles from the gutters of Mexico,'&mdash;a record having absolutely no connection
either with the mythical deluge, already described as one of the four destructions
of the world, or with any other. The bird speaking in the picture, he
connects with a well-known Mexican fable given by Torquemada, in which a
bird is described as speaking from a tree to the leaders of the Mexicans at a
certain stage of their migration, and repeating the work <i>Tihui</i>, that is to say,
'Let us go.' A little bird called the <i>Tihuitochan</i>, with a cry that the vulgar still
interpret in a somewhat similar sense, is well known in Mexico, and is perhaps
at the bottom of the tradition. It may be added that Torquemada gives
a painted manuscript, possibly that under discussion, as his authority for the
story. The boat, the mountain, and the other adjuncts of the picture are
explained in a like simple way, as the hieroglyphics, for the most part, of
various proper names. Our space here will not permit further details&mdash;though
another volume will contain this picture and a further discussion of
the subject&mdash;but I may remark in concluding that the moderation with
which Señor Ramirez discusses the question, as well as his great experience
and learning in matters of Mexican antiquity, seem to claim for his views
the serious consideration of future students.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_II-35" href="#FNanchor_II-35"><span class="label">[II-35]</span></a> This tradition was 'gathered principally from the relations of Con

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_II-36" href="#FNanchor_II-36"><span class="label">[II-36]</span></a> The legendary Montezuma, whom we shall meet so often in the mythology
of the Gila valley, must not be confounded with the two Mexican monarchs
of the same title. The name itself would seem, in the absence of proof
to the contrary, to have been carried into Arizona and New Mexico by the
Spaniards or their Mexican attendants, and to have become gradually associated
in the minds of some of the New Mexican and neighboring tribes, with
a vague, mythical, and departed grandeur. The name Montezuma became
thus, to use Mr. Tylor's words, that of the great 'Somebody' of the tribe.
This being once the case, all the lesser heroes would be gradually absorbed
in the greater, and their names forgotten. Their deeds would become his
deeds, their fame his fame. There is evidence enough that this is a general
tendency of tradition, even in historical times. The pages of Mr. Cox's
scholarly and comprehensive work, <i>The Mythology of the Aryan Nations</i>, teem
with examples of it. In Persia, deeds of every kind and date are referred to
Antar. In Russia, buildings of every age are declared to be the work
of Peter the Great. All over Europe, in Germany, France, Spain, Switzerland,
England, Scotland, Ireland, the exploits of the oldest mythological
heroes figuring in the Sagas, Eddas, and Nibelungen Lied have been ascribed
in the folk-lore and ballads of the people to Barbarossa, Charlemagne, Boabdil,
Charles V., William Tell, Arthur, Robin Hood, Wallace, and St. Patrick.
The connection of the name of Montezuma with ancient buildings and legendary
adventures in the mythology of the Gila valley seems to be simply another
example of the same kind.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_II-37" href="#FNanchor_II-37"><span class="label">[II-37]</span></a> I am indebted for these particulars of the belief of the Pimas to the
kindness of Mr. J. H. Stout of the Pima agency, who procured me a personal
interview with five chiefs of that nation, and their very intelligent and
obliging interpreter, Mr. Walker, at San Francisco, in October, 1873.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_II-38" href="#FNanchor_II-38"><span class="label">[II-38]</span></a> For the killing of this Great Eagle Szeukha had to do a kind of penance,
which was never to scratch himself with his nails, but always with a
small stick. This custom is still observed by all Pimas; and a bit of wood,
renewed every fourth day, is carried for this purpose stuck in their long hair.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_II-39" href="#FNanchor_II-39"><span class="label">[II-39]</span></a> With the reader, as with myself, this clause will probably call up something
more than a mere suspicion of Spanish influence tinging the incidents
of the legend. The Pimas themselves, however, asserted that this tradition
existed among them long before the arrival of the Spaniards and was not
modified thereby. One fact that seems to speak for the comparative purity
of their traditions is that the name of Montezuma is nowhere to be found in
them, although Cremony, <i>Apaches</i>, p. 102, states the contrary.</p>

any qualities not material. But Dunn, <i>The Oregon Territory</i>, p. 284, and
Dixon, <i>Voyage Round the World</i>, pp. 189-90, describe at least some tribe or
tribes of the Thlinkeets and many tribes of the Haidahs, that consider the sun
to be a great spirit moving over the earth once every day, animating and
keeping alive all creatures, and, apparently, as being the origin of all; the
moon is a subordinate and night watcher.</p>

Khanukh, which is best presented in his own words:&mdash;'The Klinkits do not
believe in one Supreme Being, but in a host of good and evil spirits, above
whom are towering two lofty beings of godlike magnitude, who are the principal
objects of Indian reverence. These are Yethl and Kanugh&mdash;two
brothers; the former the benefactor and well-wisher of mankind, but of a
very whimsical and unreliable nature; the latter the stern God of War, terrible
in his wrath, but a true patron of every fearless brave. It is he who
sends epidemics, bloodshed and war to those who have displeased him,
while it seems to be the principal function of Yethl to cross the sinister purposes
of his dark-minded brother. Yethl and Kanugh lived formerly on
earth, and were born of a woman of a supernatural race now passed away,
about the origin and nature of which many conflicting legends are told, hard
to comprehend. When Yethl walked on earth and was quite young he acquired
great skill in the use of the bow and arrow. He used to kill large
birds, assume their shape and fly about. His favorite bird was the raven;
hence its name, "Yethl," which signifies "raven" in the Klinkit language.
He had also the fogs and clouds at his command, and he would often draw
them around him to escape his enemies. His brother's name, Kanugh, signifies
"wolf," consequently "raven" and "wolf" are the names of the two
gods of the Klinkits, who are supposed to be the founders of the Indian
race.'</p>

strongly the Nootka ideas with regard to the sanctity of the moon and sun,
as well as the connection of the sun with the fire, it may be well to call attention
to the two following customs:&mdash;'El Tays [chief] no puede hacer uso de sus
mugeres sin ver enteramente iluminado el disco de la luna.' <i>Sutil y Mexicana</i>,
<i>Viage</i>, p. 145. 'Girls at puberty ... are kept particularly from the sun or
fire.' <i>Bancroft's Nat. Races</i>, vol. i., p. 197. In this connection it may be mentioned
that Mr Lord, <i>Naturalist</i>, vol. ii., p. 257, saw among the Nootkas
while at Fort Rupert, a very peculiar Indian "medicine," a solid piece of
native copper, hammered flat, oval it would appear from the description, and
painted with curious devices, eyes of all sizes being especially conspicuous.
The Hudson-Bay traders call it an "Indian copper," and said it was only
exhibited on extraordinary occasions, and that its value to the tribe was estimated
at fifteen slaves or two hundred blankets. This "medicine" was preserved
in an elaborately ornamented wooden case, and belonging to the tribe,
not to the chief, was guarded by the medicine-men. Similar sheets of copper
are described by Schoolcraft as in use among certain of the Vesperic
aborigines: May they all be intended for symbols of the sun, such as that
reverenced by the Peruvians?</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_V-22" href="#FNanchor_V-22"><span class="label">[V-22]</span></a> Father Boscana, one of the earliest missionaries to Upper California,
left behind him the short manuscript history from which the tradition following
in the text has been taken&mdash;through the medium of a now rare translation
by Mr Robinson. Filled with the prejudices of its age and of the profession
of its author, it is yet marvelously truthlike; though a painstaking care
has evidently been used with regard to its most apparently insignificant
details, there are none of those too visible wrenchings after consistency, and
fillings up of lacunae which so surely betray the hand of the sophisticator
in so many monkish manuscripts on like and kindred subjects. There are
found on the other hand frank confessions of ignorance on doubtful points,
and many naïve and puzzled comments on the whole. It is apparently the
longest and the most valuable notice in existence on the religion of a nation of
the native Californians, as existing at the time of the Spanish conquest, and
more worthy of confidence than the general run of such documents of any
date whatever. The father procured his information as follows. He says:
'God assigned to me three aged Indians, the youngest of whom was over
seventy years of age. They knew all the secrets, for two of them were
<i>capitanes</i>, and the other a <i>pul</i>, who were well instructed in the mysteries. By
gifts, endearments, and kindness, I elicited from them their secrets, with
their explanations; and by witnessing the ceremonies which they performed,
I learned by degrees, their mysteries. Thus, by devoting a portion of the
nights to profound meditation, and comparing their actions with their disclosures,

379. Fremont gives an account of the birth of Montezuma. His mother was,
it is said, a woman of exquisite beauty, admired and sought after by all men,
they making her presents of corn and skins and all that they had; but the
fastidious beauty would accept nothing of them but their gifts. In process
of time a season of drought brought on a famine and much distress; then it
was that the rich lady showed her charity to be as great in one direction as
it had been wanting in another. She opened her granaries and the gifts of
the lovers she had not loved went to relieve the hungry she pitied. At last
with rain, fertility returned to the earth; and on the chaste Artemis of the
Pueblos its touch fell too. She bore a son to the thick summer shower and
that son was Montezuma.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_VI-60" href="#FNanchor_VI-60"><span class="label">[VI-60]</span></a> Father Bernardino de Sahagun, a Spanish Franciscan, was one of the
first preachers sent to Mexico; where he was much employed in the instruction
of the native youth, working for the most part in the province of
Tezcuco. While there, in the city of Tepeopulco, in the latter part of the
sixteenth century, he began the work, best known to us as the <i>Historia
General de las Cosas de Nueva España</i>, from which the above prayers have
been translated, and from which we shall draw largely for further information.
It would be hard to imagine a work of such a character constructed
after a better fashion of working than his. Gathering the principal natives of
the town in which he carried on his labors, he induced them to appoint him
a number of persons, the most learned and experienced in the things of which
he wished to write. These learned Mexicans being collected, Father Sahagun
was accustomed to get them to paint down in their native fashion the
various legends, details of history and mythology, and so on that he wanted; at
the foot of the said pictures these learned Mexicans wrote out the explanations
of the same in the Mexican tongue; and this explanation the Father Sahagun
translated into Spanish: that translation purports to be what we now
read as the <i>Historia General</i>. Here follows a translation of the Prologo of
his work, in which he describes all the foregoing in his own way: "All
writers labor the best that they can to make their works authoritative; some
by witnesses worthy of faith, others by the writings of previous writers held
worthy of belief, others by the testimony of the Sacred Scriptures. To me
are wanting all these foundations to make authoritative what I have written
in these twelve books [of the <i>Historia General</i>]. I have no other foundation,
but to set down here the relation of the diligence that I made to know
the truth of all that is written in these twelve books. As I have said in other
prologues to this work, I was commanded in all holy obedience by my chief
prelate to write in the Mexican language that which appeared to me to be
useful for the doctrine, worship, and maintenance of Christianity among
these natives of New Spain, and for the aid of the workers and ministers that
taught them. Having received this commandment, I made in the Spanish
language a minute or memorandum of all the matters that I had to treat of,
which matters are what is written in the twelve books, ... which were begun
in the pueblo of Tepeopulco, which is in the province of Culhuacán or Tezcuco.
The work was done in the following way. In the aforesaid pueblo, I
got together all the principal men, together with the lord of the place, who
was called Don Diego de Mendoza, of great distinction and ability, well experienced
in things ecclesiastic, military, political, and even relating to idolatry.
They being come together, I set before them what I proposed to do, and
prayed them to appoint me able and experienced persons, with whom I
might converse and come to an understanding on such questions as I might
propose. They answered me that they would talk the matter over and give
their answer on another day; and with this they took their departure. So
on another day the lord and his principal men came, and having conferred
together with great solemnity, as they were accustomed at that time to do,
they chose out ten or twelve of the principal old men, and told me that with
these I might communicate and that these would instruct me in any matters
I should inquire of. Of these there were as many as four instructed in Latin,
to whom I, some few years before, had myself taught grammar in the college
of Santa Cruz, in Tlaltelolco. With these appointed principal men, including
the four instructed in grammar, I talked many days during about two
years, following the order of the minute I had already made out. On all the
subjects on which we conferred they gave me pictures&mdash;which were the
writings anciently in use among them&mdash;and these the grammarians interpreted
to me in their language, writing the interpretation at the foot of
the picture. Even to this day I hold the originals of these.... When I went
to the chapter, with which was ended the seven years' term of Fray Francisco
Torál&mdash;he that had imposed the charge of this work upon me&mdash;I was removed
from Tepeopulco, carrying all my writings. I went to reside at Santiago
del Tlaltelolco. There I brought together the principal men, set before
them the matter of my writings, and asked them to appoint me some able
principal men, with whom I might examine and talk over the writings I had
brought from Tepeopulco. The governor, with the alcaldes, appointed me
as many as eight or ten principal men, selected from all the most able in their
language, and in the things of their antiquities. With these and with four
or five collegians, all trilinguists, and living for the space of a year or more
secluded in the college, all that had been brought written from Tepeopulco
was clearly emended and added to; and the whole was rewritten in small
letters, for it was written with much haste. In this scrutiny or examination,
he that worked the hardest of all the collegians was Martin Jacobita, who
was then rector of the college, an inhabitant of the ward of Santa Ana. I,
having done all as above said in Tlaltelolco, went, taking with me all my
writings, to reside in San Francisco de México, where, by myself, for the space
of three years, I examined over and over again the writings, emended them,
divided them into twelve books, and each book into chapters and paragraphs.
After this, Father Miguel Navarro being provincial, and Father Diego de
Mendoza commissary-general in Mexico, with their favor I had all the
twelve books clearly copied in a good hand, as also the <i>Postilla</i> and the <i>Cantáres</i>
[which were other works on which Sahagun was engaged]. I made
out also an Art of the Mexican language with a vocabulary-appendix. Now
the Mexicans added to and emended my twelve books [of the <i>Historia General</i>]
in many things while they were being copied out in full; so that the first
sieve through which my work passed was that of Tepeopulco, the second
that of Tlaltelolco, the third that of Mexico; and in all these scrutinies collegiate
grammarians had been employed. The chief and most learned was Antonio
Valeriano, a resident of Aztcapuzalco; another little less than the first,
was Alonso Vegerano, resident of Cuauhtitlan; another was Martin Jacobita,
above mentioned; another Pedro de Santa Buenaventura, resident of Cuauhtitlan;
all expert in three languages, Latin, Spanish, and Indian [Mexican].
The scribes that made out the clear copies of all the works are Diego
Degrado, resident of the ward of San Martin, Mateo Severino, resident of Xochimilco,
of the part of Ullác. The clear copy being fully made out, by the
favor of the fathers above mentioned and the expenditure of hard cash on the
scribes, the author thereof asked of the delegate Father Francisco de Rivera
that the work be submitted to three or four religious, so that they might give
an opinion on it, and that in the provincial chapter, which was close at hand,
they might attend and report on the matter to the assembly, speaking as
the thing might appear to them. And these reported in the assembly that
the writings were of much value and deserved such support as was necessary
toward their completion. But to some of the assembly it seemed that it
was contrary to their vows of poverty to spend money in copying these writings;
so they commanded the author to dismiss his scribes, and that he
alone with his own hand should do what copying he wanted done; but as he
was more than seventy years old, and for the trembling of his hand not able
to write anything, nor able to procure a dispensation from this mandate,
there was nothing done with the writings for more than five years. During
this interval, and at the next chapter, Father Miguel Navarro was elected
by the general chapter for custos custodium, and Father Alonso de Escalona,
for provincial. During this time the author made a summary of all the
books and of all the chapters of each book, and prologues, wherein was said
with brevity all that the books contained. This summary Father Miguel
Navarro and his companion, Father Gerónimo de Mendieta, carried to Spain,
and thus in Spain the things that had been written about this land made
their appearance. In the mean time, the father provincial took all the
books of the author and dispersed them through all the province, where they
were seen by many religious and approved for very precious and valuable.
After some years, the general chapter meeting again, Father Miguel Navarro,
at the petition of the author, turned with censures to collect again the said
books; which, from that collecting, came within about a year into the
hands of the author. During that time nothing was done in them, nor was
there any one to help to get them translated into the vernacular Spanish,
until the delegate-general Father Rodrigo de Sequera came to these parts,
saw and was much pleased with them, and commanded the author to translate
them into Spanish; providing all that was necessary to their being re-written,
the Mexican language in one column and the Spanish in another, so that they
might be sent to Spain; for the most illustrious Señor Don Juan de Ovando,
president of the Council of Indies, had inquired after them, he knowing of
them by reason of the summary that the said Father Miguel Navarro had
carried to Spain, as above said. And all the above-said is to show that this
work has been examined and approved by many, and during many years
has passed through many troubles and misfortunes before reaching the place
it now has." <i>Sahagun</i>, <i>Hist. Gen.</i>, tom. i., lib. i., Prólogo, pp. iii. vii. As to
the date at which Sahagun wrote he says: 'These twelve books and the Art
and the vocabulary-appendix were finished in a clear copy in the year 1569;
but not translated into Spanish.' <i>Sahagun</i>, <i>Hist. Gen.</i>, tom. ii., lib. i., Introduccion,
p. xv. The following scanty sketch of the life of Sahagun, is taken,
after Bustamante, from the <i>Menealógio Seráfico</i> of Father Betancourt: 'Father
Bernardino Sahagun, native of Sahagun, took the robe in the convent
of Salamanca, being a student of that university. He passed into this province
[Mexico] in the year 1529, in the company of Father Antonio de Ciudad
Rodrigo. While a youth he was endowed with a beauty and grace of person
that corresponded with that of his soul. From his tenderest years he was
very observant, self-contained, and given to prayer. Father Martin de Valencia
held very close communion with him, owing to which he saw him
many times snatched up into an ecstasy. Sahagun was very exact in his attendance
in the choir, even in his old age, he never was absent at matins.
He was gentle, humble, courteous in his converse with all. He was
elected secondly with the learned Father Juan de Gaona, as professor at
Tlaltelolco in the college of Santa Cruz; where he shone like a light
on a candlestick, for he was perfect in all the sciences. His possession
of the Mexican language was of a perfectness that has never to this day
being equaled; he wrote many books in it that will be mentioned in the
catalogue of authors. He had to strive with much opposition, for to some
it did not seem good to write out in the language of the Mexicans their
ancient rites, lest it should give occasion for their being persevered in. He
watched over the honor of God against idolatry, and sought earnestly to
impress the Christian faith upon the converted. He affirmed as a minister
of much experience, that during the first twenty years [of his life in the
province] the fervor of the natives was very great; but that afterward they
inclined to idolatry, and became very lukewarm in the faith. This he says
in the book of his <i>Postillas</i> that I have, in which I learnt much. During the
first twenty years of his life [in the province] he was guardian of some convents;
but after that he desired not to take upon himself any office or guardianship
for more than forty years, so that he could occupy himself in
preaching, confessing, and writing. During the sixty and one years that
he lived in the province, for the most part in college, without resting a single
day, he instructed the boys in civilization and good customs, teaching them
reading, writing, grammar, music, and other things in the service of God
and the state. This went on till the year 1590, when, the approach of death
becoming apparent to every one, he entered the hospital of Mexico; where he
died on the 23rd of October. There assembled to his funeral the collegians,
trailing their <i>becas</i>, and the natives shedding tears, and the members of the
different religious houses giving praises to God our Lord for this holy death,
of which the martyrology treats&mdash;Gonzaga, Torquemada, Deza, Rampineo,
and many others. In the library of Señor Eguiara, in the manuscript of the
Turriana collection, I have read the article relating to Father Sahagun; in it
a large catalogue of works that he wrote is given. I remember only the following:
<i>Historia General de las Cosas de Nueva España</i>; <i>Arte de gramática
mexicana</i>; <i>Diccionario trilingue de español, latin, y mexicano</i>; <i>Sermones
para todo el año en mexicano</i>, (poséo aunque sin nombre de autor); <i>Postillas
ó commentarios al evangelio, para las misas solemnes de dia de precepto</i>;
<i>Historia de los primeros pobladores franciscanos en Mexico</i>; <i>Salmodia de la
vida de Cristo, de la virgen y de los santos, que usaban los indios, y preceptos
para los casados</i>; <i>Escala espiritual</i>, que fué la primera obra que se imprimió
en Mexico en la imprenta que trajo Hernan Cortés de España.' <i>Sahagun</i>,
<i>Hist. Gen.</i>, tom. i., pp. vii.-ix. As to the manner in which the <i>Historia
General</i> of Sahagun, 'whom,' says Prescott, <i>Mex.</i>, vol. i., p. 67,
'I have followed as the highest authority' in matters of Mexican religion&mdash;at
last saw the light of publication, I give Prescott's account,
<i>Mex.</i>, vol. i., p. 88, as exact save in one point, for which see the correction
in brackets:&mdash;'At length, toward the close of the last century, the indefatigable
Muñoz succeeded in disinterring the long lost manuscript from the
place tradition had assigned to it&mdash;the library of a convent at Tolosa, in Navarre,
the northern extremity of Spain. With his usual ardor, he transcribed
the whole work with his own hands, and added it to the inestimable collection,
of which, alas! he was destined not to reap the full benefit himself.
From this transcript Lord Kingsborough was enabled to procure the copy
which was published in 1830, in the sixth volume of his magnificent compilation.
[It was published in two parts, in the fifth and seventh volumes of that
compilation, and the exact date of the publication was 1831.] In it he expresses
an honest satisfaction at being the first to give Sahagun's work to the world.
But in this supposition he was mistaken. The very year preceding, an edition
of it, with annotations, appeared in Mexico, in three volumes 8vo. It was
prepared by Bustamante&mdash;a scholar to whose editorial activity his country
is largely indebted&mdash;from a copy of the Muñoz manuscript which came into
his possession. Thus this remarkable work, which was denied the honors
of the press during the author's lifetime, after passing into oblivion, reappeared,
at the distance of nearly three centuries, not in his own country, but
in foreign lands widely remote from each other, and that almost simultaneously....
Sahagun divided his history into twelve books. The first eleven
are occupied with the social institutions of Mexico, and the last with the
Conquest. On the religion of the country he is particularly full. His great
object evidently was, to give a clear view of its mythology, and of the burdensome
ritual which belonged to it. Religion entered so intimately into
the most private concerns and usages of the Aztecs, that Sahagun's work
must be a text-book for every student of their antiquities. Torquemada
availed himself of a manuscript copy, which fell into his hands before it was
sent to Spain, to enrich his own pages&mdash;a circumstance more fortunate for
his readers than for Sahagun's reputation, whose work, now that it is published,
loses much of the originality and interest which would otherwise
attach to it. In one respect it is invaluable; as presenting a complete collection
of the various forms of prayer, accommodated to every possible emergency,
in use by the Mexicans. They are often clothed in dignified and
beautiful language, showing that sublime speculative tenets are quite compatible
with the most degrading practices of superstition. It is much to be
regretted that we have not the eighteen hymns, inserted by the author in his
book, which would have particular interest, as the only specimen of devotional
poetry preserved of the Aztecs. The hieroglyphical paintings, which
accompanied the text are also missing. If they have escaped the hands of
fanaticism, both may reappear at some future day.' As may have been
noticed, the editions of Sahagun by both Bustamante and Kingsborough have
been constantly used together and collated during the course of this present
work. They differ, especially in many minor points of typography, Bustamante's
being the more carelessly edited in this respect. Notwithstanding,
however, the opinion to the contrary of Mr Harrisse, Bustamante's edition
is on the whole the more complete; Kingsborough having avowedly omitted
divers parts of the original which he thought unimportant or uninteresting&mdash;a
fault also of Bustamante's, but to a lesser extent. Fortunately what is
absent in the one I have always found in the other; and indeed, as a whole,
and all circumstances being considered, they agree tolerably well. The criticism
of Mr Harrisse, just referred to, runs as follows, <i>Bib. Am. Vet.</i>, p. 208,
note 52: '<i>Historia General de las Cosas de Nueva España</i>; Mexico, 3 vols., 4to,
1829 (edited and castrated by Bustamente [Bustamante] in such a manner as
to require for a perfect understanding of that dry but important work, the
reading of the parts also published in vols. v. and vi. [v. and vii.], of Kingsborough's
<i>Antiquities</i>.)' We are not yet done, however, with editions of Sahagun.
A third edition of part of his work has seen the light. It is Bustamante
himself that attempts to supersede a part of his first edition. He affirms, that
book xii. of that first edition of his, as of course also book xii. of Kingsborough's
edition, is spurious and has been garbled and glossed by Spanish hands
quite away from the original as written by Sahagun. Exactly how or when
this corruption took place he does not show; but he leaves it to be inferred
that it was immediately after the original manuscript had been taken from
its author, and that it was done because that twelfth book, which treats more
immediately of the Conquest, reflected too hardly on the Conquerors. Bustamante
having procured, in a manner now to be given in his own words, a
correct and genuine copy of the twelfth book, a copy written and signed
by the hand of Sahagun himself, proceeded in 1840 to give it to the world
under the extraordinary title of <i>La Aparicion de Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe
de Mexico, comprobada con la refutacion del argumento negativo que presenta D.
Juan Bautista Muñoz, fundandose en el testimonio del P. Fr. Bernardino Sahagun;
ó sea, Historia Original de este Escritor, que altera la publicada en 1829 en
el equivocado concepto de ser la unica y original del dicho autor</i>. All of which
means to say that he, Bustamante, having already published in 1829-30, a
complete edition of Sahagun's <i>Historia General</i>, in twelve books, according
to the best manuscript he could then find, has found the twelfth book of that
history to be not genuine, has found the genuine original of said twelfth
book, and now, in 1840, publishes said genuine twelfth book under the above
extraordinary name, inasmuch as it contains some reference to what is
supposed to be uppermost in every religious Mexican's mind, to wit, the
miraculous appearance of the Blessed Virgin to a certain native Mexican,
la aparicion de nuestra Señora de Guadalupe de Mexico. Bustamante's own
account of all the foregoing, being translated from the above-mentioned <i>Nra.
Señora de Guadalupe</i>, pp. iv., viii., xxiii., runs as follows: 'As he [Sahagun]
wrote with the frankness proper to truth, and as this was not pleasing to the
heads of the then government, nor even to some of his brother friars, he was
despoiled of his writings. These were sent to Spain, and ordered to be stored
away in the archives of the convent of San Francisco de Tolosa de Navarra,
so that no one should ever be able to read them; there they lay hid for more
than two centuries. During the reign of Carlos iii., Señor Muñoz was commissioned
to write the history of the New World. But he found himself
without this work [of Sahagun's] so necessary to his purpose; and he was
ignorant of its whereabouts, till, reading the index of the Biblioteca Franciscana
he came to know about it, and, furnished by the government with all
powers, he took it out of the said monastery. Colonel D. Diego Garcia
Panes having come to Madrid at the same time, to publish the works of Señor
Veytia, this gentleman contracted a friendship with Muñoz who allowed him
to copy the two thick volumes in which Sahagun's work was written....
These two volumes, then, that Colonel Panes had copied, were what was held
to be solely the work of Father Sahagun, and as such esteemed; still it does
not appear to be proved by attestation that this was the author's original <i>autograph</i>
history. Had it been so, the circumstance would hardly have been
left without definite mention, when the relation was given of the way in
which the book was got hold of, and when the guarantee of the exactness of
the copy was procured. I, to-day, possess an original manuscript, written
altogether and signed by the hand of Father Sahagun; in which is to be
noted an essential variation in certain of the chapters which I now present,
from those that I before published in the twelfth book of his <i>Historia General</i>;
which is the book treating of the Conquest. Sahagun wrote this manuscript
in the year 1585, that is to say, five years before his death, and he
wrote it without doubt under a presentiment of the alterations that his work
would suffer. He had already made alterations therein himself, since he
confesses (they are his words) that certain defects existed in them, that certain
things had been put into the narrative of that Conquest that should not have
been put there, while other things were left out that should not have been
omitted. Therefore [says Bustamante], this autograph manuscript discovers
the alterations that his writings underwent and gives us good reason to doubt
the authenticity and exactness of the text seen by Muñoz.... During the revolution
of Madrid, in May, 1808, caused by the entrance of the French and
the removal of the royal family to Bayonne, the office of the secretary of the
Academy of History was robbed, and from it were taken various bundles of
the works of Father Sahagun. These an old lawyer of the court bought, and
among them one entitled: <i>Relacion de la conquista de esta Nueva España, como
la contaron los soldados indios que se hallaron presentes. Convertióse en lengua
española llana é inteligible y bien enmendada en este año de 1585</i>. Unfortunately
there had only remained [of the <i>Relacion</i>, etc., (?)] a single volume
of manuscript, which Señor D. José Gomez de la Cortina, ex-count of that
title, bought, giving therefor the sum of a hundred dollars. He allowed
me the use of it, and I have made an exact copy of it, adding notes
for the better understanding of the Conquest; the before-mentioned
being altogether written, as I have said, and signed by the hands of
Father Sahagun. This portion, which the said ex-count has certified to,
induces us to believe that the other works of Sahagun, relating both to
the Conquest and to the Aparicion Guadalupana have been adulterated
because they did little honor to the first Conquerors. That they have at
all come to be discussed with posterity, has been because a knowledge of
them was generally scattered, and in such a way that it was no longer possible
to keep them hidden; or, perhaps, because the faction interested in their
concealment had disappeared. In proof of the authenticity and identity of
this manuscript, we refer to Father Betancur in his Chronicle of the province
of the Santo Evangelio de México, making a catalogue of the illustrious
men thereof; speaking of Sahagun, he says on page 138: "The ninth
book that this writer composed was the Conquest of Mexico by Cortés;
which book afterward, in the year 1585, he re-wrote and emended; the
[emended] original of this I saw signed with his hand in the possession of Señor
D. Juan Francisco de Montemayor, president of the Royal Audiencia, who
carried it to Spain with the intention of having it printed; and of this I have
a translation wherein it is said that the Marquis of Villa-Manrique, viceroy
of Mexico, took from him [Sahagun] the twelve books and sent them to his
majesty for the royal chronicler." Bustamante lastly gives a certificate of
the authenticity of the manuscript under discussion and published by him.
The certificate is signed by José Gomez de la Cortina, and runs as follows:
'Mexico, 1st April, 1840. I certify that, being in Madrid in the year 1828, I
bought from D. Lorenzo Ruiz de Artieda, through the agency of my friend
and companion, D. José Musso Valiente, member of the Spanish Academies
of language and of history, the original manuscript of Father Sahagun, of
which mention is made in this work by his Excellency Señor D. Cárlos María
Bustamante, as constated by the receipts of the seller, and by other documents
in my possession.' So much for Bustamante's new position as a
reëditor of a part of Sahagun's <i>Historia General</i>; we have stated it in his
own words, and in those of his own witnesses as brought forward by him. The
changes referred to do not involve any matter bearing on mythology; it may
be not out of place to say however, that the evidence in favor of Bustamante's
new views seems strong and truth-like.</p>

to remark that this fable was very generally current among the
Mexicans, and that when Father Bernardino de Sahagun was in the city of
Xuchimilco, they asked him where Tlapalla was. Sahagun replied that he
did not know, as indeed he did not (nor any one else&mdash;it being apparently
wholly mythical), nor even understand their question, inasmuch as he had
been at that time only a little while in the country&mdash;it being fifty years before
he wrote his book [the <i>Historia General</i>]. Sahagun adds that the Mexicans
made at that time divers trials of this kind, questioning the Christians to
see if they knew anything of their antiquities. <i>Torquemada</i>, <i>Monarq. Ind.</i>,
tom. ii., p. 50.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_VII-23" href="#FNanchor_VII-23"><span class="label">[VII-23]</span></a> The passage of Torquemada referred to I condense as follows:&mdash;Certain
people came from the north by way of Panuco. These were men of
good carriage, well-dressed in long robes of black linen, open in front, and
without capes, cut low at the neck, with short sleeves that did not come to
the elbow; the same, in fact, as the natives use to this day in their dances.
From Panuco they passed on very peaceably by degrees to Tulla, where they
were well received by the inhabitants. The country there, however, was
already too thickly populated to sustain the new-comers, so these passed on
to Cholula where they had an excellent reception. They brought with
them as their chief and head, a personage called Quetzalcoatl, a fair and
ruddy complexioned man, with a long beard. In Cholula these people
remained and multiplied, and sent colonies to people Upper and Lower Mizteca
and the Zapotecan country; and these it is said raised the grand edifices,
whose remains are still to be seen at Mictlan. These followers of Quetzalcoatl
were men of great knowledge and cunning artists in all kinds of fine
work; not so good at masonry and the use of the hammer, as in casting and
in the engraving and setting of precious stones, and in all kinds of artistic
sculpture, and in agriculture. Quetzalcoatl had, however, two enemies;
Tezcatlipoca was one, and Huemac, king of Tulla the other; these two had
been most instrumental in causing him to leave Tulla. And at Cholula,
Huemac followed him up with a great army; and Quetzalcoatl, not wishing
to engage in any war, departed for another part with most part of his people&mdash;going,
it is said, to a land called Onohualco, which is near the sea, and
embraced what are now called Yucatan, Tabasco, and Campeche. Then
when Huemac came to the place where he had thought to find Quetzalcoatl,
and found him not, he was wrath and laid waste and destroyed all the
country, and made himself lord over it and caused also that the people worshipped
him as a god. All this he did to obscure and blot out the memory
of Quetzalcoatl and for the hate that he bore him. <i>Torquemada</i>, <i>Monarq.

ordres de dieux, dont les uns, tombés du ciel dans l'abîme où ils deviennent
les juges des morts, se personnifient en un seul qui ressuscite, symbole de la
vie et de la mort; dont les autres survivent à la destruction, symbole de la
vie impérissable; tel est le double caractère du mythe de Quetzal-Coatl, à son
origine. Mais en réalité, ce dieu, c'est la terre, c'est la région ensevelie sous
les eaux, c'est le vaincu étouffé sous le poids de son adversaire, sous l'effort
de la vague victorieuse et celle-ci s'unissant au feu sur le bûcher de Nanahuatl,
c'est Tezcatlipoca, c'est Hercule, vainqueur de ses ennemis, c'est le dieu
dont la lutte est éternelle, comme celle de l'Océan battant le rivage, c'est
celui en qui se personnifie ensuite la lumière et qui devient ainsi le drapeau
des adversaires de Quetzal-Coatl. Au dieu mort, il fallait une victime, comme
lui, descendue dans l'abîme: ce fut une jeune fille, choisie parmi celles
qui lui étaient consacrées au pied de la pyramide, et qu'on noyait en la
plongeant sous l'eau, coutume qu'on retrouva longtemps en Egypte, comme
à Chichen-Itza, ainsi que dans bien d'autres pays du monde. Mais au dieu
ressuscité, au dieu en qui se personnifiait le feu, la vie immortelle, à <i>Quetzal-Coatl</i>,
devenu <i>Huitzil-Opochtli</i>, on sacrifia des victimes sans nombre, à qui
l'on arrachait le c&oelig;ur, symbole du jet de flamme sortant du volcan, pour

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_VIII-9" href="#FNanchor_VIII-9"><span class="label">[VIII-9]</span></a> This Paynalton, or Paynal, was a kind of deputy-god, or substitute for
Huitzilopochtli; used in cases of urgent haste and immediate emergency,
where perhaps it might be thought there was not time for the lengthened
ceremonies necessary to the invocation of the greater war deity. Sahagun's
account of Paynal is concise, and will throw light on the remarks of
Torquemada, as given above in the text. Sahagun says, in effect: This god
Paynal was a kind of sub-captain to Huitzilopochtli. The latter, as chief-captain,
dictated the deliberate undertaking of war against any province; the
former, as vicar to the other, served when it became unexpectedly necessary to
take up arms and make front hurriedly against an enemy. Then it was that
Paynal&mdash;whose name means 'swift, or hurried,'&mdash;when living on earth set
out in person to stir up the people to repulse the enemy. Upon his death
he was deified and a festival appointed in his honor. In this festival, his
image, richly decorated, was carried in a long procession, every one, bearer
of the idol or not, running as fast as he could; all of which represented the
promptness that is many times necessary to resist the assault of a foe attacking
by surprise or ambuscade. <i>Sahagun</i>, <i>Hist. Gen.</i>, tom. i., lib. i., p. 2.</p>

of the character of Toci or Tocitzin that of Goddess of Discord may
be condensed from Acosta, as follows: When the Mexicans, in their
wanderings, had settled for a time in the territory of Culhuacan, they were
instructed by their god Huitzilopochtli to go forth and make wars, and first
to apotheosize, after his directions, a Goddess of Discord. Following these
directions, they sent to the king of Culhuacan for his daughter to be their
queen. Moved by the honor, the father sent his hapless daughter, gorgeously
attired, to be enthroned. But the wiley, superstitious, and ferocious
Mexicans slew the girl and flayed her, and clothed a young man in her skin,
calling him 'their goddess and mother of their god,' under the name of
Toccy, that is 'grand mother.' See also <i>Purchas his Pilgrimes</i>, vol. iv.,
p. 1004.</p>

to Centeotl, if she be identical with the earth-mother, are illustrated
by the statement of Mendieta, <i>Hist. Ecles.</i>, p. 81, that the Mexicans painted
the earth-goddess as a frog with a bloody mouth in every joint of her body,
(which frog we shall meet again by and by in a Centeotl festival) for they
said that the earth devoured all things&mdash;a proof also, by the by, among
others of a like kind which we shall encounter, that not to the Hindoos alone
(as Mr J. G. Müller somewhere affirms), but to the Mexicans also, belonged
the idea of multiplying the organs of their deities to express great powers in
any given direction. The following note from the <i>Spiegazione delle Tavole
del Codice Mexicano</i>, in <i>Kingsborough's Mex. Antiq.</i>, vol. v., pp. 179-80, illustrates
the last point noticed, gives another form or relation of the goddess of
sustenance, and also the origin of the name applied to the Mexican
priests: 'They feign that Mayaguil was a woman with four hundred breasts,
and that the gods, on account of her fruitfulness, changed her into the
Maguey, which is the vine of that country, from which they make wine.
She presided over these thirteen signs; but whoever chanced to be born on
the first sign of the Herb, it proved unlucky to him; for they say that it was
applied to the Tlamatzatzguex, who were a race of demons dwelling amongst
them, who according to their account wandered through the air, from whom
the ministers of their temples took their denomination. When this sign
arrived, parents enjoined their children not to leave the house, lest any misfortune
or unlucky accident should befall them. They believed that those
who were born in Two Canes, which is the second sign, would be long lived,
for they say that that sign was applied to heaven. They manufacture so
many things from this plant called the Maguey, and it is so very useful in that
country, that the devil took occasion to induce them to believe that it was a
god, and to worship and offer sacrifices to it.'</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_IX-5" href="#FNanchor_IX-5"><span class="label">[IX-5]</span></a> <i>Sahagun</i>, <i>Hist. Gen.</i>, tom. i., lib. i., pp. 5-6; Gallatin, in <i>Amer. Ethnol.
Soc., Transact.</i>, vol. i., pp. 341, 349-50, condensing from and commenting
upon the codices Vaticanus and Tellerianus says: 'Tonacacigua, alias
Tuchiquetzal (plucking rose), and Chicomecouatl (seven serpents); wife of
Tonacatlecotle; the cause of sterility, famine, and miseries of life....
Amongst Sahagun's superior deities is found Civacoatl, the 'serpent woman,'
also called Tonantzin, 'our mother;' and he, sober as he is in Scriptural
allusions, calls her Eve, and ascribes to her, as the interpreters [of the
codices] to Tonatacinga, all the miseries and adverse things of the world.
This analogy is, if I am not mistaken, the only foundation for all the allusions
to Eve and her history, before, during, and after the sin, which the interpreters
have tried to extract from paintings which indicate nothing of the
kind. They were certainly mistaken in saying that their Tonacacinga was
also called Chicomecouatl, seven serpents. They should have said Civacoatl,
the serpent woman. Chicomecoatl, instead of being the cause of sterility,
famine, etc., is, according to Sahagun, the goddess of abundance, that which
supplies both eating and drinking: probably the same as Tzinteotl, or Cinteotl,
the goddess of maize (from <i>centli</i>, maize), which he does not mention.
There is no more foundation for ascribing to Tonacacigua the name of Suchiquetzal.'
Gama, <i>Dos Piedras</i>, pt i., p. 39, says in effect: Cihuacounatl,
or snake woman, was supposed to have given birth to two children, male
and female, whence sprung the human race. It is on this account that
twins are called in Mexico <i>cocohua</i>, 'snakes,' or in the singular cohuatl or
coatl, now vulgarly pronounced coate.</p>

The goddess of water, amongst the Mexicans, bore the name of <i>Chalchiuilcuye</i>,
the woman of the <i>Chalchiuites</i>, and the name of <i>Chalchiuihapan</i> was
often applied to the city of Tlaxcalla, from a beautiful fountain of water

According to Bustamante however, this bird is not one in anyway remarkable
for plumage, but is identical with the <i>tzacua</i> described by Clavigero, and
is here used as an example of a vigilant and active soldier. Bustamante (in
a note to <i>Sahagun</i>, <i>Hist. Gen.</i>, tom. ii., lib. vi., pp. 194-5) writes: <i>Tzacua</i>,
of this bird repeated mention has been made in this history, for the Indians
used it for a means of comparison or simile in their speeches. It is an early-rising
bird (madrugador), and has nothing notable in its plumage or in its
voice, but only in its habits. This bird is one of the last to go to rest at
night and one of the first to announce the coming sun. An hour before daybreak
a bird of this species, having passed the night with many of his fellows
on any branch, begins to call them, with a shrill clear note that he
keeps repeating in a glad tone till some of them reply. The <i>tzacua</i> is about
the size of a sparrow, and very similar in color to the bunting (calandria),
but more marvellous in its habits. It is a social bird, each tree is a town of
many nests. One <i>tzacua</i> plays the part of chief and guards the rest; his post
is in the top of the tree, whence, from time to time, he flies from nest to nest
uttering his notes; and while he is visiting a nest all within are silent. If
he sees any bird of another species approaching the tree he sallies out upon
the invader and with beak and wings compels a retreat. But if he sees a
man or any large object advancing, he flies screaming to a neighboring
tree, and, meeting other birds of his tribe flying homeward, he obliges them
to retire by changing the tone of his note. When the danger is over he returns
to his tree and begins his rounds as before, from nest to nest. Tzacuas
abound in Michoacan, and to their observations regarding them the Indians
are doubtless indebted for many hints and comparisons applied to soldiers
diligent in duty. The <i>quechutl</i>, or <i>tlauhquechol</i>, is a large aquatic bird with
plumage of a beautiful scarlet color, or a reddish white, except that of the
neck, which is black. Its home is on the sea-shore and by the river banks,
where it feeds on live fish, never touching dead flesh. See <i>Clavigero</i>, <i>Storia
Ant. del Messico</i>, tom. i., pp. 87, 91-3.</p>

<i>Sahagun</i>, <i>Hist. Gen.</i>, tom. ii., lib. vi., pp. 215-221. According to some authors,
and I think Boturini for one, this baptism was supplemented by passing
the child through fire. There was such a ceremony; however, it was
not connected with that of baptism, but it took place on the last night of
every fourth year, before the five unlucky days. On the last night of every
fourth year, parents chose god-parents for their children born during the
three preceding years, and these god-fathers and god-mothers passed the
children over, or near to, or about the flame of a prepared fire (<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">rodearlos por
las llamas del fuego que tenian aparejado para esto, que en el latin se dice
<i>lustrare</i></span>). They also bored the children's ears, which caused no small uproar
(<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Habia gran voceria de muchachos y muchachas por el ahugeramiento
de las orejas</span>) as may well be imagined. They clasped the children by the
temples and lifted them up 'to make them grow;' wherefore they called the
feast <i>izcalli</i>, 'growing.' They finished by giving the little things pulque
in tiny cups, and for this the feast was called the 'drunkenness of children.'
<i>Sahagun</i>, <i>Hist. Gen.</i>, tom. i., lib. ii., pp. 189-192. In the <i>Spiegazione delle
Tavole del Codice Mexicano</i> (Vaticano), tav. xxxi., in <i>Kingsborough's Mex.
Antiq.</i>, vol. v., p. 181, there is given a description of the water baptism differing
somewhat from that given in the text. It runs as follows: 'They
took some ficitle; and having a large vessel of water near them, they made
the leaves of the ficitle into a bunch, and dipped it into the water, with
which they sprinkled the child; and after fumigating it with incense, they
gave it a name, taken from the sign on which it was born; and they put into
its hand a shield and arrow, if it was a boy, which is what the figure of
Xiuatlatl denotes, who here represents the god of war; they also uttered
over the child certain prayers in the manner of deprecations, that he
might become a brave, intrepid, and courageous man. The offering which
his parents carried to the temple the elder priests took and divided with the
other children who were in the temple, who ran with it through the whole
city.' Mendieta, <i>Hist. Ecles.</i>, p. 107, again describes this rite, in substance
as follows: 'They had a sort of baptism: thus when the child was a few
days old, an old woman was called in, who took the child out into the court
of the house where it was born, and washed it a certain number of times
with the wine of the country, and as many times again with water; then
she put a name on it, and performed certain ceremonies with the umbilical
cord. These names were taken from the idols, or from the feasts that
fell about that time, or from a beast or bird.' See further <i>Esplicacion
de la Coleccion de Mendoza</i>, pt iii., in <i>Kingsborough's Mex. Antiq.</i>, vol.
v., pp. 90-1; <i>Torquemada</i>, <i>Monarq. Ind.</i>, tom. ii., pp. 445, 449-458; <i>Clavigero</i>,

<i>Müller</i>, <i>Amerikanische Urreligionen</i>, p. 652; <i>Biart</i>, <i>La Terre Tempéreé</i>, p.
274. Mr Tylor, speaking of Mexico, in his <i>Anahuac</i>, p. 279, says:
'Children were sprinkled with water when their names were given
to them. This is certainly true, though the statement that they
believed that the process purified them from original sin is probably
a monkish fiction.' Farther reading, however, has shown Mr Tylor the
injustice of this judgment, and in his masterly latest and greatest work (see
<i>Primitive Culture</i>, vol. ii., pp. 429-36), he writes as follows: 'The last group
of rites whose course through religious history is to be outlined here, takes
in the varied dramatic acts of ceremonial purification or lustration. With
all the obscurity and intricacy due to age-long modification, the primitive
thought which underlies these ceremonies is still open to view. It is the transition
from practical to symbolic cleansing, from removal of bodily impurity
to deliverance from invisible, spiritual, and at last moral evil. (See this vol. <a href="#Page_119">p.
119</a>).... In old Mexico, the first act of ceremonial lustration took place at
birth. The nurse washed the infant in the name of the water-goddess, to remove
the impurity of its birth, to cleanse its heart and give it a good and perfect
life; then blowing on water in her right hand she washed it again, warning
it of forthcoming trials and miseries and labors, and praying the invisible
Deity to descend upon the water, to cleanse the child from sin and foulness,
and to deliver it from misfortune. The second act took place some four
days later, unless the astrologers postponed it. At a festive gathering, amid
fires kept alight from the first ceremony, the nurse undressed the child sent
by the gods into this sad and doleful world, bade it to receive the life-giving
water, and washed it, driving out evil from each limb and offering to the
deities appointed prayers for virtue and blessing. It was then that the toy
instruments of war or craft or household labor were placed in the boy's or
girl's hand (a custom singularly corresponding with one usual in China),
and the other children, instructed by their parents, gave the new-comer its
child-name, here again to be replaced by another at manhood or womanhood.
There is nothing unlikely in the statement that the child was also passed
four times through the fire, but the authority this is given on is not sufficient.
The religious character of ablution is well shown in Mexico by its forming
part of the daily service of the priests. Aztec life ended as it had
begun, with the ceremonial lustration; it was one of the funeral ceremonies
to sprinkle the head of the corpse with the lustral water of this life.'</p>

tom. i., lib. i., pp. 10-16. Prescott writes, <i>Mex.</i>, vol. i., p. 68: 'It is remarkable
that they administered the rites of confession and absolution.
The secrets of the confessional were held inviolable, and penances were imposed
of much the same kind as those enjoined in the Roman Catholic
Church. There were two remarkable peculiarities in the Aztec ceremony.
The first was, that, as the repetition of an offence, once atoned for, was
deemed inexpiable, confession was made but once in a man's life, and was
usually deferred to a late period of it, when the penitent unburdened his
conscience, and settled, at once, the long arrears of iniquity. Another peculiarity
was, that priestly absolution was received in place of the legal punishment
of offences, and authorized an acquittal in case of arrest.' Mention of
Tlazolteotl will be found in <i>Gomara</i>, <i>Conq. Mex.</i>, fol. 309; <i>Torquemada</i>,
<i>Monarq. Ind.</i>, tom. ii., pp. 62, 79; <i>Herrera</i>, <i>Hist. Gen.</i>, tom. i., dec. ii., lib. vi.,
cap. xv.; <i>Clavigero</i>, <i>Storia Ant. del Messico</i>, tom. ii., p. 21. They say that
Yxcuina, who was the goddess of shame, protected adulterers. She was the
goddess of salt, of dirt, and of immodesty, and the cause of all sins. They
painted her with two faces, or with two different colors on the face. She
was the wife of Mizuitlantecutli, the god of hell. She was also the goddess
of prostitutes; and she presided over these thirteen signs, which were all unlucky,
and thus they held that those who were born in these signs would be
rogues or prostitutes. <i>Spiegazione delle Tavole del Codice Mexicano</i>, (Vaticano),

as peculiarly honored in their paintings: They place Michitlatecotle opposite
to the sun, to see if he can rescue any of those seized upon by the lords
of the dead, for Michitla signifies the dead below. These nations painted
only two of their gods with the crown called Altoutcatecoatle, viz., the God
of heaven and of abundance and this lord of the dead, which kind of crown
I have seen upon the captains in the war of Coatle. <i>Explicacion del Codex

who alone after Tonacatecotle was painted with a crown, which kind of a
crown was used in war even after the arrival of the Christians in those countries,
and was seen in the war of Coatlan, as the person who copied these
paintings relates, who was a brother of the Order of Saint Dominic, named
Pedro de los Rios. They painted this demon near the sun; for in the same
way as they believed that the one conducted souls to heaven, so they supposed
that the other carried them to hell. He is here represented with his hands

from him. <i>Spiegazione delle Tavole del Codice Mexicano</i> (Vaticano), tav. xxxiv.,

or Zitzimitl; Yzpunteque, the lame demon, who appeared in the
streets with the feet of a cock; Nextepelma, scatterer of ashes; and Contemoque,
he who descends head-foremost. These four have goddesses, not as wives,
but as companions, which was the simple relation in which all the Mexican
god and goddesses stood to one another, there having been&mdash;according to
most authorities&mdash;in their olympus neither marrying nor giving in marriage.
Picking our way as well as possible across the frightful spelling of the interpreter,
the males and females seem paired as follows: To Miquitlamtecotl or
Tzitzimitl, was joined as goddess, Miquitecacigua; to Yzpunteque, Nexoxocho;
to Nextepelma, Micapetlacoli; and to Contemoque, Chalmecaciuatl. <i>Spiegazione

<i>Clavigero</i>, <i>Storia Ant. del Messico</i>, tom. ii., pp. 6, 17. Gallatin,
<i>Amer. Ethnol. Soc., Transact.</i>, vol. i., pp. 350-1, says that 'Mictlanteuctli is
specially distinguished by the interpreters as one of the crowned gods. His
representation is found under the basis of the statue of Teoyaomiqui, and
Gama has published the copy. According to him, the name of that god
means the god of the place of the dead. He presided over the funeral of
those who died of diseases. The souls of all those killed in battle were led
by Teoyaomiqui to the dwelling of the sun. The others fell under the dominion
of Mictanteuctli.' <i>Torquemada</i>, <i>Monarq. Ind.</i>, tom. i., pp. 77, 148, 447,
tom. ii., p. 428. Brasseur de Bourbourg mentions this god and his wife,
bringing up several interesting points, for which, however, he must bear the
sole responsibility: <i>S'il Existe des Sources de l'Hist. Prim.</i>, pp. 98-9. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">'Du
fond des eaux qui couvraient le monde, ajoute un autre document mexicain
(<i>Cod. Mex. Tell.-Rem.</i>, fol. 4, v.), le dieu des régions d'en bas. <i>Mictlan-Teuctli</i>
fait surgir un monstre marin nommé <i>Cipactli</i> ou <i>Capactli</i> (<i>Motolinia</i>, <i>Hist.
Antig. de los Indios</i>, part. MS. Dans ce document, au lieu de <i>cipactli</i> il y a
<i>capactli</i>, qui n'est peut-être qu'une erreur du copiste, mais qui, peut-être
aussi est le souvenir d'une langue perdue et qui se rattacherait au <i>capac</i> ou
<i>Manco-Capac</i> du Pérou.): de ce monstre, qui a la forme d'un caïman, il crée
la terre (<i>Motolinia</i>, <i>Ibid.</i>). Ne serait-ce pas là le crocodile, image du temps,
chez les Égyptiens, et ainsi que l'indique Champollion (Dans <i>Herapollon</i>, i.,
69 et 70, le crocodile est le symbole du couchant et des ténèbres) symbole
également de la <i>Région du Couchant</i>, de l'<i>Amenti</i>? Dans l'Orcus mexicain,
le prince des Morts, <i>Mictlan-Teuctli</i>, a pour compagne <i>Mictecacihuatl</i>,
celle qui étend les morts. On l'appelle <i>Ixcuina</i>, ou la déesse au
visage peint ou au double visage, parce qu'elle avait le visage de
deux couleurs, rouge avec le contour de la bouche et du nez peint en
noir (<i>Cod. Mex. Tell.-Rem.</i>, fol. 18, v.). On lui donnait aussi le nom de
<i>Tlaçolteotl</i>, la déesse de l'ordure, ou <i>Tlaçolquani</i>, la mangeuse d'ordure, parce
qu'elle présidait aux amours et aux plaisirs lubriques avec ses trois s&oelig;urs.
On la trouve personifiée encore avec <i>Chantico</i>, quelquefois représentée comme
un chien, soit à cause de sa lubricité, soit à cause du nom de <i>Chiucnauh-Itzcuintli</i>
ou les Neuf-Chiens, qu'on lui donnait également (<i>Cod. Mex. Tell.-Rem.</i>,
fol. 21, v.). C'est ainsi que dans l'Italie anté-pélasgique, dans la
Sicile et dans l'île de Samothrace, antérieurement aux Thraces et aux Pélasges,
on adorait une Zérinthia, une Hécate, déesse Chienne qui nourrissait
ses trois fils, ses trois chiens, sur le même autel, dans la demeure souterraine;
l'une et l'autre rappelaient ainsi le souvenir de ces hétaires qui veillaient au
pied des pyramides, où elles se prostituaient aux marins, aux marchands et
aux voyageurs, pour ramasser l'argent nécessaire à l'érection des tombeaux des
rois. "Tout un calcul des temps, dit Eckstein (<i>Sur les sources de la Cosmogonie
de Sanchoniathon</i>, pp. 101, 197), se rattache à l'adoration solaire de cette
déesse et de ses fils. Le Chien, le Sirius, règne dans l'astre de ce nom, au
zénith de l'année, durant les jours de la canicule. On connaît le cycle ou la
période que préside l'astre du chien: on sait qu'il ne se rattache pas seulement
aux institutions de la vieille Égypte, mais encore à celles de la haute
Asie." En Amérique le nom de la déesse <i>Ixcuina</i> se rattache également à la
constellation du sud, où on la personnifie encore avec <i>Ixtlacoliuhqui</i>, autre
divinité des ivrognes et des amours obscènes: les astrologues lui attribuaient
un grand pouvoir sur les événements de la guerre, et, dans les derniers temps,
on en faisait dépendre le châtiment des adultères et des incestueux (<i>Cod. Mex.
Tell.-Rem.</i>, fol. 16, v.).'</span> See also, <i>Brinton's Myths</i>, pp. 130-7; <i>Leon y Gama</i>,

by some to be this Mexican goddess of war, or of death, Teoyaomique,
Mr Tylor says, <i>Anahuac</i>, pp. 222-3: 'The stone known as the statue of the
war-goddess is a huge block of basalt covered with sculptures. The antiquaries
think that the figures on it stand for different personages, and that
it is three gods&mdash;Huitzilopochtli the god of war, Teoyaomiqui his wife, and
Mictlanteuctli the god of hell. It has necklaces of alternate hearts and dead
men's hands, with death's head for a central ornament. At the bottom of
the block is a strange sprawling figure, which one cannot see now, for it is
the base which rests on the ground; but there are two shoulders projecting
from the idol, which show plainly that it did not stand on the ground, but
was supported aloft on the tops of two pillars. The figure carved upon the
bottom represents a monster holding a skull in each hand, while others hang
from his knees and elbows. His mouth is a mere oval ring, a common feature
of Mexican idols, and four tusks project just above it. The new moon
laid down like a bridge forms his forehead, and a star is placed on each side
of it. This is thought to have been the conventional representation of Mictlanteuctli
(Lord of the land of the dead), the god of hell, which was a place
of utter and eternal darkness. Probably each victim as he was led to the
altar could look up between the two pillars and see the hideous god of hell
staring down upon him from above.'</p>

<i>Torquemada</i>, <i>Monarq. Ind.</i>, tom. ii., pp. 529-30. Of the compound idol
discussed above, Humboldt, <i>Vues des Cordillères</i>, tom. ii., pp. 153-7, speaks
at some length. He says: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">'On distingue, à la partie supérieure, les têtes de
deux monstres accolés et l'on trouve, à chaque face, deux yeux et une large
gueule armée de quatre dents. Ces figures monstrueuses n'indiquent peut-être
que des masques: car, chez les Mexicains, on étoit dans l'usage de masquer
les idoles à l'époque de la maladie d'un roi, et dans toute autre calamité
publique. Les bras et les pieds sont cachés sous une draperie entourée
d'énormes serpens, et que les Mexicains designoient sous le nom de <i>cohuatlicuye,
vêtement de serpent</i>. Tous ces accessoires, surtout les franges en forme
de plumes, sont sculptés avec le plus grand soin. M. Gama, dans un mémoire
particulier, a rendu très-probable que cette idole représente le dieu de
la guerre, <i>Huitzilopochtli</i>, ou <i>Tlacahuepancuexcotzin</i>, et sa femme, appelée
<i>Teoyamiqui</i> (de <i>miqui</i>, mourir, et de <i>teoyao</i>, guerre divine), parcequ'elle
conduisoit les ames des guerriers morts pour la défense des dieux, à la <i>maison
du Soleil</i>, le paradis des Mexicains, où elle les transformoit en colibris.
Les têtes de morts et les mains coupées, dont quatre entourent le sein de la
déesse, rappellent les horribles sacrifices (<i>teoquauhquetzoliztli</i>) célébrés dans
la quinzième période de treize jours, après le solstice d'été, à l'honneur du
dieu de la guerre et de sa compagne <i>Teoyamiqui</i>. Les mains coupées alternent
avec la figure de certains vases dans lesquels on brûloit l'encens. Ces
vases étoient appelés <i>top-xicalli sacs en forme de calebasse</i> (de <i>toptli</i>, bourse
tissue de fil de pite, et de <i>xicali</i>, calebasse). Cette idole étant sculptée sur
toutes ses faces, même par dessous (fig. 5), où l'on voit représenté <i>Mictlanteuhtli,
le seigneur du lieu des morts</i>, on ne sauroit douter qu'elle étoit soutenue
en l'air au moyen de deux colonnes sur lesquelles reposoient les parties marquées
A et B, dans les figures 1 et 3. D'après cette disposition bizarre, la
tête de l'idole se trouvoit vraisemblablement élevée de cinq à six mètres au-dessus
du pavé du temple, de manière que les prêtres (<i>Teopixqui</i>) traînoient
les malheureuses victimes à l'autel, en les faisant passer au-dessous de la
figure de <i>Mictlanteuhtli</i>.'</span></p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_IX-53" href="#FNanchor_IX-53"><span class="label">[IX-53]</span></a> According to Brasseur de Bourbourg, in <i>Nouvelles Annales des Voyages</i>,
1858, tom. clx., pp. 267-8: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">'Les héros et demi-deux qui, sous le nom générique
de Chichemèques-Mixcohuas, jouent un si grand rôle dans la mythologie mexicaine,
et qui du vii<sup>e</sup> au ix<sup>e</sup> siècle de notre ère, obtinrent la prépondérance sur
le plateau aztèque.... Les plus célèbres de ces héros sont Mixcohuatl-Mazatzin
(le Serpent Nébuleux et le Daim), fondateur de la royauté à Tollan (aujourd'hui
Tula), Tetzcatlipoca, spécialement adoré à Tetzeuco, et son frère
Mixcohuatl le jeune, dit Camaxtli, en particulier adoré à Tlaxcallan, l'un et
l'autre mentionnés, sous d'autres noms, parmi les rois de Culhuacan et considérés,
ainsi que le premier, comme les principaux fondateurs de la monarchie
toltèque. On ignore où ils reçurent le jour. Un manuscrit mexicain,
[Codex Chimalpopoca], en les donnant pour fils d'Iztac-Mixcohuatl ou le
Serpent Blanc Nébuleux et d'Iztac-Chalchiuhlicué ou la Blanche Dame
azurée, fait allégoriquement allusion aux pays nébuleux et aquatiques où ils
ont pris naissance; le même document ajoute qu'ils vinrent par eau et qu'ils
demeurèrent un certain temps en barque. Peut-être que le nom d'Iztac ou
Blanc, également donné à Mixcohuatl, désigne aussi une race différente de
celle des Indiens et plus en rapport avec la nôtre.'</span></p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_IX-66" href="#FNanchor_IX-66"><span class="label">[IX-66]</span></a> These human sacrifices were begun, according to Clavigero, <i>Storia Ant.
del Messico</i>, tom. i., pp. 165-7, by the Mexicans, before the foundation of their
city, while yet slaves of the Culhuas. These Mexicans had done good service
to their rulers in a battle against the Xochimilcas. The masters were
expected to furnish their serfs with a thank-offering for the war god. They
sent a filthy rag and a rotten fowl. The Mexicans received and were silent.
The day of festival came; and with it the Culhua nobles to see the sport&mdash;the
Helots and their vile sacrifice. But the filth did not appear, only a
coarse altar, wreathed with a fragrant herb, bearing a great flake of keen-ground
obsidian. The dance began, the frenzy mounted up, the priests
advanced to the altar, and with them they dragged four Xochimilca prisoners.
There is a quick struggle, and over a prisoner bruised, doubled back
supine on the altar-block gleams and falls the itzli, driven with a two-handed
blow. The blood spurts like a recoil into the bent face of the high priest, who
grabbles, grasps, tears out and flings the heart to the god. Another, another,
another, and there are four hearts beating in the lap of the grim image.
There are more dances but there is no more sport for the Culhuas: with lips
considerably whitened they return to their place. After this there could be
no more mastership, nor thought of mastership over such a people; there
was too much of the wild beast in them; they had already tasted blood.
And the Mexicans were allowed to leave the land of their bondage, and journey
north toward the future Tenochtitlan.</p>

that this great gladiatorial block was sometimes to an extraordinary extent a
'stone of sacrifice' to the executioners as well as to the doomed victim. In
the last year of the reign of the last Montezuma, a famous Tlascaltec general,
Tlahuicol, was captured by the merest accident. His strength of arm was
such that few men could lift his <i>maquahuil</i>, or sword of the Mexican type,
from the ground. Montezuma, too proud to use such an inglorious triumph,
or perhaps moved by a sincere admiration of the terrible and dignified warrior,
offered him his liberty, either to return to Tlascala, or to accept high
office in Mexico. But the honor of the chief was at stake, as he understood
it; and not even a favor would he accept from the hated Mexican; the
death, the death! he said, and, if you dare, by battle on the gladiatorial
stone. So they tied him, (by the foot says Clavigero), upon the <i>temalacatl</i>,
armed with a great staff only, and chose out champions to kill him from the
most renowned of the warriors; but the grim Tlascaltec dashed out the brains
of eight with his club, and hurt twenty more, before he fell, dying like himself.
They tore out his heart, as of wont, and a costlier heart to Mexico
never smoked before the sun.</p>

being followed, 'the hook-nosed;' and it is curious enough that this type of

particular astuteness in trade, should be the characteristic of the Mexican
god of trade: <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">'Los mercaderes tuvieron Dios particular, al qual llamaron

here necessary as a camp-fire and probably, at any rate, a

the merchants themselves. Describing a certain coming down or arrival of
the gods among men, believed to take place in the twelfth Mexican month,
Sahagun&mdash;after describing the coming, first of Tezcatlipoca, who, 'being a
youth, and light and strong, walked fastest,' and then the coming of all
the rest (their arrival being known to the priests by the marks of their feet
on a little heap of maize flour, specially prepared for the purpose)&mdash;says that
a day after all the rest of the gods, came the god of fire and the god of the
merchants, together; they being old and unable to walk as fast as their
younger divine brethren: <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">'El dia siguiente llegaba el dios de los Mercaderes

to what month and day of the month it corresponds in our own Gregorian
calendar. For the complete discussion of this question of the calendar
we refer readers to the preceding volume of this series. Gama was unfortunately
unacquainted with the writings of Sahagun, and Bustamante (who
edited the works both of Gama and Sahagun) remarks in a note to the
writings of the astronomer: <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">'Muchas veces he deplorado, que el sábio Sr. D.

ceremonies which took place ten days before the great feast day, which account
has been followed by Torquemada, Clavigero, and later writers, and
which we reproduce from the quaint but in this case at least full and accurate
translation of E. G.&mdash;a translation which, however, makes this chapter the
29th of the fifth book instead of the 28th as in the original: 'Then came forth
one of the chiefe of the temple, attired like to the idoll, carrying flowers in
his hand, and a flute of earth, having a very sharpe sound, and turning towards
the east, he sounded it, and then looking to the west, north and south
he did the like. And after he had thus sounded towards the foure parts of the
world (shewing that both they that were present and absent did heare him)
hee put his finger into the aire, and then gathered vp earth, which he put in
his mouth, and did eate it in signe of adoration. The like did all they that
were present, and weeping, they fell flat to the ground, invocating the darknesse
of the night, and the windes, intreating them not to leave them, nor to
forget them, or else to take away their lives, and free them from the labors
they indured therein. Theeves, adulterers, and murtherers, and all others
offendors had great feare and heavinesse, whilest this flute sounded; so as
some could not dissemble nor hide their offences. By this meanes they all
demanded no other thing of their god, but to have their offences concealed,
powring foorth many teares, with great repentaunce and sorrow, offering great
store of incense to appease their gods. The couragious and valiant men,
and all the olde souldiers, that followed the Arte of Warre, hearing this flute,
demaunded with great devotion of God the Creator, of the Lorde for whome
wee live, of the sunne, and of other their gods, that they would give them
victorie against their ennemies, and strength to take many captives, therewith
so honour their sacrifices. This ceremonie was doone ten dayes before the
feast: During which tenne dayes the Priest did sound this flute, to the end
that all might do this worship in eating of earth, and demaund of their idol
what they pleased: they every day made their praiers, with their eyes lift vp
to heaven, and with sighs and groanings, as men that were grieved for their
sinnes and offences.'</p>

who was also high-priest of Huitzilopochtli, and Tlaloctlamacazqui,
who was Tlaloc's chief priest; they were equals, and elected from the most
perfect, without reference to birth. <i>Hist. Gen.</i>, tom. i., lib. iii., pp. 276-7.
There are two inconsistencies in this, the only strong contradiction of the
statement of the above, as well as several other authors, who form the authority
of my text: first, Sahagun calls the first high-priest Quetzalcoatl
Teotectlamacazqui, a name which scarcely accords with the title of Huitzilopochtli's
high-priest; secondly, he ignores the almost unanimous evidence
of old writers, who state that the latter office was hereditary in a certain
district. <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">'Al Summo Pontìfice llamaban en la lengua mexicana Tehuatecolt.'

<i>Hist. Nat. Civ.</i>, tom. iii., pp. 549-51, whose chief authority is Hernandez,
and who is not very clear in his description, holds that the Mexicatlteohuatzin
was the supreme priest, and that he also bore the title of
Teotecuhtli, the rank of chief priest of Huitzilopochtli, and was the right
hand minister of the king. Quetzalcoatl's high-priest he places next in
rank, but outside of the political sphere. On one page he states that the
high-priest was elected by the two chief men in the hierarchy, and on another
he distinctly implies that the king made the higher appointments in
order to control the church. The sacrificing priest, whom he evidently
holds to be the same as the high-priest, he invests with the rank of generalissimo,
and heir to the throne.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_X-9" href="#FNanchor_X-9"><span class="label">[X-9]</span></a> Carbajal states that a temple bearing the name of the people, or their
chief town, was erected in the metropolis, and attended by a body of priests
brought from the province. <i>Discurso</i>, p. 110. This may, however, be a misinterpretation
of Torquemada, who gives a description of a building attached
to the chief temple at Mexico, in which the idols of subjugated people were
kept imprisoned, to prevent them from aiding their worshipers to regain
their liberty.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_X-10" href="#FNanchor_X-10"><span class="label">[X-10]</span></a> Some authors seem to associate this office with that of the pontiff, but
it appears that the high-priest merely inaugurated the sacrifices on special
occasions. <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">'Era esta vna dignidad suprema, y entre ellos tenida en mucho,
la qual se heredaua como cosa de mayorazgo. El ministro que tenia oficio
de matar ... era tenido y reuerenciado como supreme Sacerdote, o Pontifice.'
<i>Acosta</i>, <i>Hist. de las Ynd.</i>, p. 352.</span> <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">'Era como decir, el Sumo Sacerdote, al
qual, y no à otro, era dado este oficio de abrir los Hombres por los pechos,
... siendo comunmente los herederos, de este Patrimonio, y suerte Eclesiastica,
los primogenitos.' <i>Torquemada</i>, <i>Monarq. Ind.</i>, tom. ii., p. 117.</span> It is
difficult to decide upon the interpretation of these sentences. The expression
of his being 'held or reverenced as pontiff' certainly indicates that another
priest held the office, so does the sentence, 'it was inherited by the
first-born' of certain families. But the phrase, <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">'el Sumo Sacerdote, al qual
y no à otro, era dado este oficio,'</span> points very directly to the high-priest as
the holder of the post.</p>

applied to the heads of high-priests and kings. <i>Hist. Nat. Civ.</i>, tom. iii.,

known also as Colhuas, Chanes, or Quinames. <i>Brasseur de Bourbourg</i>,
<i>Popol Vuh</i>, p. 109. The book referred to or a copy of it, written in the
Tzendal or Quiché language, was in the possession of Nuñez de la Vega,
Bishop of Chiapas, who published short extracts of it in his <i>Constitut. Di&oelig;ces</i>,
but seems to have had it burned, together with other native relics, in
1691, at Huehuetan. Previous to this, however, Ordoñez y Aguiar had obtained
a copy of it, written in Latin characters, and gave a résumé of the
contents in his <i>Hist. del Cielo</i>, MS. This author contradicts himself by stating,
in one part of his MS., that the original was written by a descendant
of Votan. <i>Brasseur de Bourbourg</i>, <i>Popol Vuh</i>, pp. lxxxvii., cviii.; <i>Tschudi's
Peruvian Antiq.</i>, p. 12; <i>Cabrera</i>, <i>Teatro</i>, in <i>Rio's Descrip.</i>, pp. 33-4. Cabrera,
who bases his account of the myth on Ordoñez' rendering, which he at times
seems to have misunderstood and mutilated, thinks that Chivim refers to
Tripoli, and it is the same as Hivim or Givim, the Ph&oelig;nician word for
snake, which, again, refers to Hivites, the descendants of Heth, son of
Canaan. Votan's expression, as given in his book, 'I am a snake, a Chivim,'
signifies 'I am a Hivite from Tripoli.' <i>Teatro</i>, in <i>Rio's Descrip.</i>, p. 34, et seq.</p>

Cabrera considers two marble columns found at Tangier, with Ph&oelig;nician
inscriptions, a trace of his route; the dwellings of the thirteen snakes are
thirteen islands of the Canary group, and Valum Votan, the Island of
Santo Domingo. <i>Teatro</i>, in <i>Rio's Descrip.</i>, p. 34, et seq. Müller, <i>Amerikanische
Urreligionen</i>, p. 489, hints significantly at the worship of the snake-god
Votan, on Santo Domingo Island, under the name of Vaudoux. Brasseur
de Bourbourg's ideas on this point have already been made pretty evident
in the account of Quetzalcoatl's myth. The thirteen snakes may mean thirteen
chiefs of Xibalba. There is a ruin bearing the name of Valum Votan
about nine leagues from Ciudad Real, Chiapas. <i>Popol Vuh</i>, p. lxxxviii. Ordoñez
holds Valum Votan to be Cuba, whence he takes seven families with
him. <i>Cabrera</i>, ubi sup.</p>

found reference to Cholula as the place where the tower of Babel was built,
and to the confusion of tongues, which tends to connect this myth with those
of the neighboring country. Ordoñez' orthodox ideas have probably added
much to the native MS. from which he took his account, yet Nuñez de la
Vega agrees with him in most respects. Cabrera, <i>Teatro</i>, in <i>Rio's Descrip.</i>,
p. 84, considers the great city to be Rome, but agrees with his authorities
that the latter edifice is the tower of Babel. A Tzendal legend relates that
a subterranean passage, leading from Palenque to Tulhá, near Ococingo, was
constructed in commemoration of the celestial passage, or 'serpent hole,'
into which Votan in his quality of snake, was admitted. <i>Brasseur de Bourbourg</i>,

new world; he recognizes the attributes of Osiris in the idol brought over by
Votan, with the intention of establishing its worship in the new world.

have been more powerful in producing mistakes in ancient history, than
the idea, hastily taken up by Christians in all ages, that every monument of
antiquity marked with a cross, or with any of those symbols which they
conceived to be monograms of Christ, were of Christian origin.... The cross
is as common in India as in Egypt, and Europe,' Mr Maurice, in his <i>Indian
Antiquities</i>, vol. ii., p. 361, writes: 'Let not the piety of the Catholic Christian
be offended at the preceding assertion that the cross was one of the
most usual symbols among the hieroglyphics of Egypt and India.' The
emblem of universal nature is equally honored in the Gentile and Christian
world. 'In the cave at Elephanta, in India, over the head of the
principal figure, again may be seen this figure (the cross), and a little in
the front the huge Lingham (phallus).'</p>

the tradition positively identifies him with Hurakan, and confirms this
by explaining on p. cclxvii., that Tohil, sometimes in himself, sometimes in
connection with the two other members of the trinity, combines the attributes
of thunder, flash, and thunderbolt; further, he gives a prayer by the
Tohil priests in which this god is addressed as Hurakan. <i>Hist. Nat. Civ.</i>,

is, besides, shown to be distinct from Tohil. Every point, therefore,

dec. iii., lib. iv., cap. vii., asserts the contrary. The latter view seems more
correct when we consider that women were not permitted to enter the temples,
and that the high priest and devotees were obliged to leave their wives
when they passed into the sanctuary. It is even probable that there was no
distinct priesthood, since the temples had no revenues, and the temple service
was performed in part at least by volunteers; to this must be added the
fact, that although the confessor might not be connected with the temple, yet
he ordered penance for its benefit. It must be considered, however, that
without regular ministers it would have been difficult to keep up the routine
of feasts and ceremonies, write the books of records, teach the children, and
maintain discipline.</p>

to blend in One Supreme Unity, as in their essential principles." Says
Sir William Jones: "We must not be surprised at finding, on a close examination,
that the characters of all the Pagan deities, male and female, melt
into each other, and at last into one or two, for it seems a well-founded
opinion that the whole crowd of gods and goddesses in ancient Rome and
modern Váránes, mean only the Powers of Nature, and principally those of

names." <i>On the Gods of Greece, Italy, and India</i>, p. 273.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_XI-120" href="#FNanchor_XI-120"><span class="label">[XI-120]</span></a> 'This suggestion was first publicly made in a communication read,'
says Squier, <i>Serpent Symbol</i>, p. 49, 'before the American Ethnological Society,
by a distinguished member of that body; from which the following passages
are extracted. After noticing several facts tending to show the former existence
of Phallic worship in America, the author of the paper proceeds
as follows:&mdash;"We come now to Central America. Upon a perusal
of the first journey of our fellow-members, Messrs. Stephens and
Catherwood, into Guatemala and the central territories of the Continent,
I was forcibly struck with the monolithic idols of Copan.
We knew nothing before, save of Mexican, Palenque, and Uxmal
remains; and those of Copan appeared to me to be unlike them all,
and probably of an older date. My reading furnishes me with but one parallel
to those singular monolithic sculptures, and that was seen in Ceylon, in
1796, by Captain Colin McKenzie, and described in the 6th volume of the
Asiatic Researches. As the description is short, I transcribe it: 'The figure
is cut out of stone in relievo; but the whole is sunk in a hollow, scooped out,
so that it is defended from injury on the sides. It may be about fourteen feet
high, the countenance wild, a full round visage, the eyes large, the nose
round and long; it has no beard; nor the usual distinguishing marks of the
Gentoo casts. He holds up both his hands, with the forefingers and thumbs
bent; the head-dress is high, and seems ornamented with jewels; on the little
finger of the left hand is a ring; on the arms bracelets; a belt high about the
waist; the lower dress or drapery fixed with a girdle much lower than the
Gentoo dress, from which something like tassels depend; a collar and ornaments
on the neck and shoulders; and rings seem to hang low from the ears.
No appearance of any arms or weapons.' This was the nearest approximation
I could make to the Copan idols; for idols I took them to be, from the fact
that an altar was invariably placed before them. From a close inspection of
Mr. Catherwood's drawings, I found that though no single figure presented
all the foregoing characteristics, yet in the various figures I could find every
particular enumerated in the Ceylon sculpture. It then occurred to me that
one of the most usual symbols of the Phallus was an erect stone, often in its
rough state, sometimes sculptured, and that no other object of heathen worship
was so often shadowed forth by a single stone placed on end, as the
Phallus. That the worship of the Priapus, [Lingam] existed in Ceylon,
has long since been satisfactorily established; and hence I was led to suspect
that these monuments at Copan, might be vestiges of a similar idolatry. A
further inspection confirmed my suspicions; for, as I supposed, I found
sculptured on the American ruins the organs of generation, and on the back
of one of the emblems relative to uterine existence, parturition, etc. I
should, however, have wanted entire confidence in the correctness of my
suspicions, had the matter rested here. On the return of Messrs. Stephens

of Yucatec feasts in chap. xxii. In citing these brutish orgies I do not
presume, or wish to assert, that they were in any way connected with phallus
worship, or indeed, that there was anything of a religious nature in them.
Still, as they certainly were indulged in during, or immediately after the great
religious festivals, and as we know how the phallic cult degenerated from its
original purity into just such bestiality in Greece and Rome, I have thought
it well to mention them. There is much truth in the following remarks on
this point, by Mr. Brinton, though with his statement that the proofs of a
recognition of the fecundating principle in Nature by the Americans are 'altogether
wanting,' I cannot agree. He says: 'There is no ground whatever to
invest these debauches with any recondite meaning. They are simply indications
of the thorough and utter immorality which prevailed throughout
the race. And a still more disgusting proof of it is seen in the frequent appearance
among diverse tribes of men dressed as women and yielding themselves
to indescribable vices. There was at first nothing of a religious nature
in such exhibitions. Lascivious priests chose at times to invest them with
some such meaning.... The pretended phallic worship of the Natchez and
of Culhuacan, cited by the Abbé Brasseur, rests on no good authority,
and if true, is like that of the Huastecs of Panuco, nothing but an unrestrained
and boundless profligacy which it were an absurdity to call a
religion. That which Mr. Stephens attempts to show existed once in Yucatan,
rests entirely by his own statement on a fancied resemblance of no value
whatever, and the arguments of Lafitau to the same effect are quite insufficient.
There is a decided indecency in the remains of ancient American art, especially
in Peru, (Meyen) and great lubricity in many ceremonies, but the proof
is altogether wanting to bind these with the recognition of fecundating principle
throughout nature, or, indeed, to suppose for them any other origin than
the promptings of an impure fancy. I even doubt whether they often referred
to fire as the deity of sexual love. By a flight of fancy inspired by a
study of oriental mythology, the worship of the reciprocal principle in America
has been connected with that of the sun and moon, as the primitive
pair from whose fecund union all creatures proceeded. It is sufficient to
say if such a myth exists among the Indians&mdash;which is questionable&mdash;it justifies
no such deduction; that the moon is often mentioned in their languages
merely as the "night sun;" and that in such important stocks as the Iroquois,
Athapascas, Cherokees, and Tupis, the sun is said to be a feminine
noun; while the myths represent them more frequently as brother and sister
than as man and wife; nor did at least the northern tribes regard the sun as
the cause of fecundity in nature at all, but solely as giving light and warmth.'

myths of the Indian a conflict between the Spirit of Good and the
Spirit of Evil, have with like unconscious error falsified his doctrine of a
future life, and almost without an exception drawn it more or less in the
likeness of a Christian heaven, hell, and purgatory.... Nowhere was any well-defined
doctrine that moral turpitude was judged and punished in the next
world. No contrast is discoverable between a place of torments and a realm
of joy; at the worst, but a negative castigation awaited the liar, the coward,
or the niggard.' <i>Myths</i>, p. 242.</p>

by the remarkable resemblance in some points between these future abodes
of the Mexicans and those of the ancient Greeks and Romans. The trembling
soul has to pass over the same dreadful river, ferried by a brute Charon.
In Hades as in Mictlan, the condition of the dead was a shadowy sort of apparent
life, in which, mere ghosts of their former selves, they continued
dreamily to perform the labors and carry on the occupations to which they
had been accustomed on earth. In Greece as in Mexico, the shades of the
dead were occasionally permitted to visit their friends on earth, summoned
by a sacrifice and religious rites. Neither Elysium nor the glorious Sun
House was the reward of the purely good so much as of the favorites of the
gods. Such points of resemblance as these are, however, unnoticed by those
who theorize concerning the origin of the Americans; they go farther for
analogies, and perhaps fare worse.</p>

many errors. As early as 1633, the Jesuit Father Paul Le Jeune wrote: "I
have remarked, in the study of their language, that there is a certain jargon

when the French use it, they think they are speaking Indian, and the Indians
using it, think they speak good French."' <i>Hist. Mag.</i>, vol. v., p. 345.</p>

Bay Company for the purpose of facilitating communication with the different
Indian tribes. These were so numerous, and their languages so
various, that the traders found it impossible to learn them all, and adopted
the device of a judicious mixture of English, French, Russian, and several
Indian tongues, which has a very limited vocabulary; but which, by the
help of signs, is readily understood by all the natives, and serves as a common
language.' <i>Milton and Cheadle's N. W. Passage</i>, p. 344. 'The jargon
so much in use all over the North Pacific Coast, among both whites and
Indians, as a verbal medium of communicating with each other, was originally
invented by the Hudson's Bay Company, in order to facilitate the progress
of their commerce with Indians.' <i>Stuart's Dictionary of Chinook Jargon</i>,

the convenience of trade.' <i>Brunot</i>, in <i>Ind. Aff. Rept.</i>, 1871, p. 124. Sproat

reliable data on which to base it, it cannot be accepted without reserve.
He says: 'it appears that Honduras was anciently occupied by at least four
distinct families or groups.' These he names: the Chorti or Sesenti, belonging
to the Maya family, the Lenca, under the various names of Chontals and
perhaps Xicaques and Poyas;&mdash;in the third he includes the various tribes
intervening between the Lencas proper and the inhabitants of Cariay, or
what is now called the Mosquito shore, such as the Toacas, Tonglas, Ramas,
etc., and lastly in the fourth, the savages who dwelt on the Mosquito shore
from near Carataska Lagoon southward to the Rio San Juan. <i>Cent.

literally, has made a very important mistake; he speaks of five languages
and only mentions four. As Herrera mentions a place Chuloteca,
some writers, and among them Mr Squier, have applied this name to a language,
but seemingly without authority. Herrera's copy reads: <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">'Hablauan
en Nicaragua, çinco lenguas diferentes, Coribizi, que lo hablan mucho en

Gomara more closely, and cites the five like him. <i>Pilgrimes</i>, vol. v., p. 887.
Mr Squier makes the following division: Dirian, Nagrandan, Choluteca, Orotina,
and Chondal. Those speaking the Aztec dialect he names Niquirans
and also counts the Choluteca as a dialect of the same. <i>Nicaragua</i>, vol. ii.,
